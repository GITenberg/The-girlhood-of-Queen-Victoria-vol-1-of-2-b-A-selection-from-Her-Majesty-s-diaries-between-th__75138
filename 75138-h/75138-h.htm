  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the preparation of this book much is due to the ungrudging help
    given to the Editor by the late Mr. Hugh Childers in the tedious and
    complicated task of tracing the numerous references to persons and
    places mentioned in the Queen’s Journals.</p>

  <p>Mr. Hugh Childers rendered valuable service to the Editors of <cite>The
    Letters of Queen Victoria</cite>, and in the preparation of this book
    his labour and trouble were no less freely expended under trying
    circumstances of failing health. His loss is deeply regretted by the
    Editor.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">These</span> extracts from the early Journals of Queen Victoria have been
    edited by command of her son, King Edward VII., and under the gracious
    auspices of her grandson, King George V.</p>

  <p>The Editor feels bound to express his humble gratitude to the King, and
    his deep obligation to the Queen, for the encouragement and assistance
    he has received from their Majesties in the preparation of these
    volumes.</p>

  <p>Without the Queen’s help and exact historical knowledge of the period
    covered by the Journals, many imperfections in the editing of them
    would have passed unnoticed.</p>

  <p>The Editor must also return his warmest thanks to H.R.H. Princess
    Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, whose retentive memory of the persons
    mentioned in the text has been unreservedly and generously brought to
    bear upon the notes to these volumes, and to H.R.H. Princess Henry of
    Battenberg, to whose pious regard for her Mother’s memory, as Executrix
    of Queen Victoria’s Will, the publication of the Journals may be
    ascribed.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, he is anxious to thank Lord Rosebery for his friendly
    co-operation in having read the proofs, and for many valuable
    suggestions.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span></p>

  <p>And, finally, he cannot sufficiently acknowledge the care
    lavished upon the publication of this book by his friend John Murray,
    junior, whose inherited gifts have been placed unreservedly at the
    disposal of the Editor.</p>

  <h3>I</h3>

  <p>Apart from the onward surge of Empire during both epochs, apart from
    the flow of scientific thought and the breeze of literary enthusiasm
    characterising them, there is much in the atmosphere of Victoria’s
    advent to the Throne, and her long and glorious tenure of it, to remind
    us of the central figure of the Elizabethan age.</p>

  <p>Both princesses were reared and educated, although for very different
    reasons, in the uncertain glory of succession to the Throne. Both
    mounted the Throne early in life alone and unprotected, at a moment of
    reaction against the abuses of monarchy. Under George III. as under
    Henry VIII. this country had been subjected to violent commotion
    consequent on the struggle for national freedom against a foreign
    power. The Reformation in England and the Napoleonic wars owed their
    successful issue to the persistent determination of the English people
    to be free. The hated marriage of Mary and the matrimonial scandals
    of George IV. had cast a gloom over the temper of the nation. Even
    the triumph of the popular cause, due to the grudging support given
    by William IV. to his Whig Ministers, had not restored the forfeited
    prestige of the Monarchy.</p>

  <p>Reaction was the corollary against the fear inspired <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>by Philip in the
    one case and the humiliating memories of Queen Caroline in the other.
    That reaction came in the shape of the popular enthusiasm inspired by a
    young and attractive Tudor princess, who at Hatfield on a late November
    afternoon in 1558 heard from Cecil that she was Queen of England. Three
    centuries later a similar outburst followed the accession of another
    youthful princess only just eighteen years old, looking scarcely
    more than a child, when she received the homage of Lord Melbourne at
    Kensington Palace on a June morning of 1837.</p>

  <p>It is tempting to follow this seductive pathway through the devious
    alleys of historical comparison and contrasts. The troubles of
    Elizabeth’s childhood at Hunsdon, the pitiful laments of her excellent
    governess at the poverty of her ward’s surroundings, and the hostile
    atmosphere surrounding her person were reflected in a minor degree
    within the precincts of Kensington during the early years of Princess
    Victoria’s life.</p>

  <p>Our concern, however, is not with Elizabeth but with Victoria, with the
    England into which she was born, and with the influences which helped
    to give her character and bearing a certain strength and dignity,
    and attuned her heart, not perhaps to deep tenderness, but to much
    compassion.</p>

  <p>The pen recoils from an attempt to tell again the story of Princess
    Victoria’s birth and early life, or to describe once more the political
    events of her first years upon the Throne. Moreover, these volumes tell
    their own tale. They set forth in the young Princess’s own artless
    words the daily facts of her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>existence at Kensington, or when making
    some provincial royal progress in the company of her mother.</p>

  <p>The reader can catch many a glimpse here and there of the soul of a
    Princess, proud and headstrong, affectionate and sometimes perverse,
    seated on the lonely heights of the Throne. The portrait is here,
    within these pages. It is not unskilfully drawn, when the youth of the
    artist is borne in mind. At the time when the first entries in these
    Journals were made, the writer was thirteen years old. The last page
    was written on the day of her marriage. She had been two years a Queen,
    and she was in her twenty-first year.</p>

  <p>Princess Victoria, the only child of the Duke and Duchess of Kent,
    and the ultimate heiress in direct succession of George III., was
    born on May 24, 1819. In 1819 the aspect of English country life
    was not very different from that of to-day; if the roads were not
    so well surfaced, and if woodlands were rather more plentiful, the
    fields and hedgerows, the farmsteads with cottages grouped around
    them, the Tudor manor-houses, the Georgian villas, the church spires,
    and the village greens have remained unchanged. Except for lines of
    railway and telegraph poles, the hop-fields of Kent and the Surrey
    commons have kept their shape and contours. So that, in spite of the
    miracles wrought by machinery in the minutiæ of life, any one of our
    grandparents cruising in an airship at an elevation of some hundreds of
    feet over the lands where he hunted and shot, or even the great town
    in which he spent his summer months, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>would probably be unconscious of
    much distinctive change.</p>

  <p>Young people, however, think it odd when they read that when Princess
    Victoria was taken from Kensington to Claremont—a journey now
    accomplished with as little thought as would then have been given to
    a drive between the Palace and Hyde Park—it was considered a “family
    removal” of such moment as to require all the provision and precautions
    associated to-day with an autumn holiday.</p>

  <p>To those still young, but old enough to remember Queen Victoria, it
    may seem hardly credible that she was born into a world devoid of
    all the marvels of steam and electric contrivance that appear to us
    the necessities, and not merely the luxuries, of life. How much more
    difficult it must be for them to realise that when the young Princess
    (whom they remember a great and mysterious figure, welcoming back
    only the other day her soldiers from South Africa, and rejoicing in
    their victories) was carried into the saloon of Kensington Palace to
    be received by Archbishop Manners Sutton into the Church of Christ,
    the mighty spirit of Napoleon brooded still behind the palisades of
    Longwood, and George III.’s white and weary head could still be seen at
    the window of his library at Windsor!</p>

  <p>The Victorian era covers the period of the expansion of England into
    the British Empire. The soldier, still young to-day, who put the
    coping-stone on the Empire in Africa in 1900 is linked by the life of
    the Queen to his forbears, who, when she <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>was born, were still nursing
    the wounds gloriously earned four years before in laying its foundation
    in a Belgian cornfield.</p>

  <p>That year 1819, however, was a year of deep despondency in England. In
    Europe it was the “glorious year of Metternich,” then at the height
    of his maleficent power. Europe was quit of Napoleon, but had got
    Metternich in exchange, and was ill pleased with the bargain. Great
    Britain, it is true, was free, but our people were overwrought by
    poverty and suffering. The storm-swell of the great Napoleonic wars
    still disturbed the surface of English life, and few realised that they
    were better off than they had been during the past decade.</p>

  <p>At Holland House, its coteries thinner but still talking, Lady
    Holland—old Madagascar—was still debating what inscription should
    record the merits of Mr. Fox upon his monument in the Abbey for
    the edification of future ages. In St. James’s Place Sam Rogers’s
    breakfasts had not lost their vogue. Tommy Moore was still dining with
    Horace Twiss, and meeting Kean, and Mrs. Siddons, “cold and queenlike,”
    on her way to view Caroline of Brunswick’s “things” shortly to be
    sold at Christie’s, or to criticise Miss O’Neill’s dress rehearsals.
    On the very day that Princess Victoria was born, Byron was writing to
    John Murray from Venice “in the agonies of a sirocco,” and clamouring
    for the proofs of the first canto of <cite>Don Juan</cite>. In that year
    <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> was finished, and in the hands of eager readers;
    whilst Scott was receiving at Abbotsford a certain Prince Leopold of
    Saxe-Coburg, uncle of the baby <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>at Kensington, destined thereafter
    to play a large part in her early life. Keats had just published
    <cite>Endymion</cite>. It was his last year in England before going south to
    die. And it was Shelley’s <i lang="la">annus mirabilis</i>: the year in which he
    wrote <cite>Prometheus</cite> and <cite>The Cenci</cite>—an achievement, some have
    since said, unparalleled in English poetry since Shakespeare lived and
    wrote.</p>

  <p><cite>The Excursion</cite> had been published five years before, but
    Wordsworth was at Rydal Mount completing <cite>The White Doe of
    Rylston</cite>. Southey was Poet Laureate. Three years before, in the
    “wild and desolate neighbourhood amid great tracts of bleak land
    enclosed by stone dykes sweeping up Clayton heights,” Charlotte
    Brontë’s eyes had opened upon her sad world. Carlyle, then a young
    teacher in Edinburgh, was passing through that stormy period of the
    soul which comes sooner or later to every one whose manhood is worth
    testing by God. And half-way between Horncastle and Spilsby, on the
    lower slope of a Lincolnshire wold, Alfred Tennyson was reading
    Pope’s <cite>Iliad</cite> and himself “writing an epic of 6,000 lines <i>à
    la</i> Walter Scott.” At Shrewsbury School under Dr. Butler, Charles
    Darwin, then a boy of ten, had already begun to develop a taste for
    “collecting,” manifested in “franks” and seals and coins. Robert
    Browning, a turbulent and destructive child of seven, had already
    commenced making rhymes less complicated, but not less ambitious,
    than those which puzzled his readers sixty years later. Goethe, who
    had grown to manhood within earshot of Frederick the Great and of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>Empress Maria Theresa, was living at Weimar with many years of life
    still before him, corresponding with the boy Mendelssohn, later to be a
    welcome guest, at Windsor, of the little Princess, then in her cradle
    in Kensington Palace. Mazzini, aged fourteen, was at the University in
    Genoa, a rebellious lad, but already affecting the deep mourning dress
    he never altered later in life. Cavour, aged nine, was at school in
    Turin. Sir Thomas Lawrence was in that year engaged in finishing his
    magnificent series of historical portraits afterwards to find a home at
    Windsor Castle, illustrating for all time the Congress of Vienna and
    the story of the Great Coalition against Napoleon.</p>

  <p>Under this galaxy of stars, some slowly sinking below the horizon, and
    others just rising above it, Princess Victoria was born.</p>

  <p>In the year following, King George III. died. Historians, mostly
    partisans of the Whig party, have not done this King justice. Of
    all Sovereigns who have ever reigned in England, none so completely
    represented the average man among his subjects. The King’s blameless
    morals, his regular habits, his conservative instincts and narrow
    obstinacy, were characteristics which he shared with the people he
    ruled. Of the House of Hanover he was the first King born in England,
    and he spoke his native tongue without a foreign accent. If he could
    have reconciled it to the family tradition, he would have married an
    English wife. He was essentially British in character and sentiment.
    Had he not been overborne by his Ministers, he would have fought <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>out
    to a finish the war with America, and peace with Washington would not
    have been concluded. He never for a moment contemplated abandoning the
    struggle against Napoleon. No party whip could have taken more trouble
    to keep his chief in office than did George III. to support Mr. Pitt
    throughout that Minister’s first administration. He has been called
    despotic, but that adjective can only be used, in speaking of him,
    in the sense that he wished to see his views prevail. He was a good
    partisan fighter, and this, in the main, his subjects never disliked.
    A close and impartial examination of the character of George III.
    discloses a temperament strongly resembling that which her Ministers
    were destined in the middle and later years of her reign to find in
    his granddaughter. Strong tenacity of view and of purpose, a vivid
    sense of duty, a firm though unrevealed belief in the transcendental
    right of the Sovereign to rule, a curious mingling of etiquette and
    domestic simplicity, and a high standard of domestic virtue were marked
    characteristics of George III. and of Queen Victoria. Both these
    descendants of Princess Sophia had little in common with the Stewarts,
    but, like Elizabeth and the Tudors, they had intense pride in England,
    and they showed a firm resolve to cherish and keep intact their mighty
    inheritance.</p>

  <p>When George III. died at Windsor in 1820, and during the ten following
    years, Princess Victoria’s uncle, George IV., reigned as King. For the
    previous ten years he had reigned as Prince Regent. If his father has
    been misjudged, this Sovereign too has <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>been misrepresented by those
    who have made it their business to write the political history of our
    country. He is generally described as being wholly bad, and devoid of
    any decent quality as a man and as a Sovereign. Decency perhaps was not
    his strong point; but though it is not possible to esteem him as a man,
    George IV. was not a bad King. In his youth, as Prince of Wales, in
    spite of glaring follies and many vices, he possessed a certain charm.
    When a boy he had broken loose from the over-strict and over-judicious
    watchfulness of his parents. Kept in monotonous seclusion, cloistered
    within the narrow confines of a Palace, fettered by an Oriental system
    of domestic spies, cut off from intercourse with the intellectual
    movement of the outer world, the royal children, warm-blooded and of
    rebellious spirit, ran secret riot after a fashion which modern memoirs
    have revealed in Borgian colours. It was a natural reaction of young
    animal life against unnatural and unhealthy restraint. The Prince of
    Wales, when he was eighteen years old, was unwillingly and perforce
    liberated. It followed, simply enough, that he became a source of
    constant grief and annoyance to his royal father. Not only were the
    canons of morality violated by him with little regard for the outward
    decorum due to his great position, but the young Prince plunged into a
    turgid sea of politics, and it was not long before he stood forth as
    the nominal head of a faction bitterly opposed to the King’s Ministers,
    and the head and front of personal offence to the King himself.</p>

  <p>In the eyes of high society he was a Prince <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>Charming, vicious if you
    will, a spendthrift and a rake, the embodiment of a reactionary spirit
    against the dulness and monotonous respectability of the Court. He
    was known to appreciate beautiful objects as well as beautiful faces.
    He was not altogether without literary culture. He appeared to be
    instinctively drawn to the arts and sciences with a full sense of the
    joy of patronage, and he made it clear to every one that he welcomed
    the free intercourse of men of all ranks, provided that they possessed
    some originality of character or some distinction of mind. In Mr. Fox
    he found a willing mentor and an irresistible boon companion. Among
    that little group of Whigs, of whom Sheridan was the ornament and
    the disgrace, he found precisely the atmosphere which suited him, so
    completely was it the antithesis of that in which his boyhood had been
    spent. As he grew older, the rose-tinted vices of his youth became grey
    and unlovely, while the shortcomings of his mind and his heart were
    more readily discerned; but much of his personal charm remained. In his
    most degenerate days, in the years of his regency and kingship, when he
    dragged into the public eye the indecencies of his domestic misfortunes
    and paraded his mistresses before the world, he still managed to retain
    a curious and genuine hold upon the affections of his Ministers.
    Although he possessed none of their regard, he was not altogether
    without some following among the people.</p>

  <p>George IV.’s merits were a certain epicurean kindness of heart and a
    not ungenerous desire to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>give pleasure, coupled with a true sense of
    his constitutional position and a firm-drawn resolve to distinguish
    between his private predilections and his public duty. The nation owes
    him very little, but in any case it owes him this, that he was the
    first Sovereign since Charles I. who showed a blundering reverence for
    beautiful things. He enlarged and consolidated the artistic wealth of
    the nation. A life-long patron of artists, he fostered the growth of
    national art. He added largely to the splendid collections which now
    adorn Windsor and the metropolis. Whatever the final judgment passed
    upon him may be, both as a man and as a Sovereign, he must in strict
    justice be spared the unqualified contempt with which superior spirits,
    taking their cue from Thackeray, have treated him. It should weigh with
    every man who reads <cite>The Four Georges</cite> that King George IV. was
    certainly liked, and was certainly not despised, by Sir Walter Scott.
    In his later years the old King displayed some little kindness to his
    niece, the young Princess Victoria, who had succeeded his own daughter
    as prospective heiress of England. If he saw her but rarely, he now
    and again betrayed knowledge of her existence, and once took her for a
    drive in his pony-carriage. There are still extant some short letters
    which she wrote to him in a large baby hand. In 1830 he died, and was
    succeeded by his brother the Duke of Clarence.</p>

  <p>William IV. was the most fortunate of the children of George III.
    Thanks to his profession as a sea-officer, he escaped early from the
    stifling atmosphere of the Court, and had the glorious privilege <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>of
    serving under the command of Hood and of Nelson. His sea service ended
    when he was only twenty-five years old. It left the usual dominant
    sea-mark upon his character. Like so many gallant sailors, his mind was
    untrained and ill-disciplined. His sense of duty was strong, though
    undiscerning. He was courageous and truthful. He had ten children by
    Mrs. Jordan born out of wedlock, but they were all well cared for and
    never disowned. He realised his constitutional duty sufficiently to
    see that he must yield to the expressed will of the nation, but he
    yielded so clumsily that all men believed him to be coerced. Wisely
    anxious to be well known and popular among his subjects, he chose the
    curious method of walking down St. James’s Street dressed in long
    boots and spurs during the most crowded hour of the afternoon. His
    predecessor had lived the last years of his life in seclusion and
    silence; he determined therefore to give full scope to his naturally
    garrulous disposition. He talked in season and out of season with an
    irresponsibility which savoured of the quarter-deck, but wholly without
    the salt of the sea. By his Ministers he was regarded with kindliness,
    although it cannot be said, in spite of Lord Grey’s panegyric, that
    they held him in much respect. By the middle classes he was looked upon
    with amused and not unfriendly amazement. In the eyes of the masses he
    was “Billy,” their sailor-King, and among monarchical safeguards there
    are few stronger than a nickname and the aureole of the Navy.</p>

  <p>William IV. married late in life Princess Adelaide <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>of
    Saxe-Coburg-Meiningen, but the fates left him with no surviving
    children when he ascended the Throne in 1830. During his reign of seven
    years the King showed much kindness to the little niece who was clearly
    designated as his successor. Her mother, however, contrived to irritate
    him by giving too much prominence to the obvious fact of her daughter’s
    heirship to the Throne. By “progresses” made on different occasions and
    undertaken with considerable ceremonial, the Duchess of Kent excited
    the wrath of the King, who made no attempt to conceal his annoyance,
    and took evident pleasure in the display of it at embarrassing moments
    in public. It was partly owing to the friction between her mother and
    King William and to the unpleasant atmosphere created in consequence of
    these quarrels, and partly to the presence in her mother’s household
    of Sir John Conroy and his family—persons very distasteful to the
    young Princess—that Queen Victoria was in the habit of saying that her
    childhood had been a sad one. These Journals, begun in her fourteenth
    year, betray no sense of childish sorrow, and no reader can glean
    from them any confirmation of her statement that her early life was
    unhappy. It must be remembered, however, that this Journal was not
    a sealed book. It was not privately put away under lock and key and
    reserved only for the eye of the writer. The young Princess’s Journals
    were commenced in a volume given to her by her mother for the express
    purpose that she should record the facts of her daily life, and that
    this record of facts and impressions should be open to the inspection
    of the child’s governess <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>as well as of her mother. It is natural,
    therefore, that the earlier volumes should contain very little beyond
    the obvious and simple things which any girl would be likely to write
    down if she were attempting to describe her life from day to day. When
    the Princess ascended the Throne and assumed her queenly independence,
    the tone of the Journals changes at once. It becomes immediately
    clear to the reader that while the Princess’s Journal was written for
    her mother, the Queen’s Journal was written for herself. One of her
    earliest entries after her succession was to state her intention of
    invariably seeing her Ministers alone; and she might have added, had
    she thought it worth stating, that her Journal also would in future be
    seen by her alone.</p>

  <p>Journals are often said to be useful to the historian. This theory
    is based on the assumption, hardly borne out by experience, that he
    who writes a journal writes what is true. A journal is supposed to
    record events, great or small, which are happening at the moment,
    and to convey impressions about personages with whom the writer
    comes in contact, or who loom sufficiently large to justify their
    being mentioned. When, however, it is remembered how inaccurate our
    information generally is, and how mistaken we often are about the
    character and motives even of those we know intimately, it is not
    surprising that the most brilliant diarist should frequently state
    facts which cannot be verified from other sources, and colour the
    personality of his contemporaries in a manner quite unjustifiable
    unless truth be deliberately sacrificed to the picturesque. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>The
    Journal of Charles Greville, perhaps the most famous of English modern
    journals, is full of gross inaccuracies in matters of fact and still
    grosser distortions of character. It is, nevertheless, a striking
    picture of the political and social world haunted by that persistent
    eavesdropper, and, like any well-written journal, throws a vivid and
    interesting light upon the character of the writer.</p>

  <p>Similar criticisms apply to most famous memoirs, like Saint-Simon’s
    or Lord Hervey’s, written with a view to serving the historian of the
    future, and with the distinct purpose of giving bias to history.</p>

  <p>They do not apply to these diaries of Queen Victoria. The Queen makes
    no attempt to analyse character or the meaning of events. She never
    strives after effect. Her statements are just homely descriptions
    of everyday life and plain references to the people she meets at
    Kensington or at Windsor. If the young Princess sees a play that
    pleases her or hears a song that touches her, she says so. If the Queen
    hears something said that strikes her as original or quaint, the saying
    is put on record. She is not writing for the historian. She writes for
    her own pleasure and amusement, although there is always present to her
    mind a vague idea, common enough at the time, that to “keep a journal”
    is in some undefined way an act of grace.</p>

  <p>The reader should not lose sight of the fact that these Journals are
    the simple impressions of a young girl, not twenty years old, about her
    own life and about the people she met. This constitutes their charm.
    She writes of her daily movements, and of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>the men and happenings that
    gave her pleasure. Either by nature or design, she avoided the mention
    of disagreeable things, so that these early Journals give one a notion
    of a life happily and simply led.</p>

  <p>If they throw no new light on the history of the period, they will give
    to future generations an insight, of never-failing interest, into the
    character of the young Queen.</p>

  <h3>II</h3>

  <p>Princess Victoria’s first Journal was commenced on August 1, 1832.
    She was thirteen years old. The first entry is made in a small octavo
    volume half bound in red morocco, of a very unpretentious kind.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
    On the first page there appear the words, “This book Mamma gave me,
    that I might write the journal of my journey to Wales in it.—Victoria,
    Kensington Palace, July 31.”</p>

  <p>The Duchess of Kent was at this time forty-six years of age. She had
    been a widow for twelve years. She was the fourth daughter of the
    Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and was first married to the Prince of
    Leiningen-Dachburg-Hadenburg. He was twenty-three years her senior.
    By him she had one son, Charles, often mentioned in these Journals,
    and one daughter Feodorowna, subsequently married to Ernest, Prince of
    Hohenlohe-Langenburg.</p>

  <p>Two years after her second marriage, to the fourth son of George III.,
    the Duchess of Kent was left a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>widow for the second time. Crippled by
    the Duke’s debts, that she was quite unable to pay,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with three young
    children on her hands, she was miserably poor. Her jointure yielded her
    an income of under £300. Her brother Leopold, then living at Claremont,
    came to her assistance, and made her an allowance of £3,000 a year.</p>

  <p>In 1825, when it became evident that her daughter Princess Victoria
    would in all probability succeed to the Throne of England, Parliament
    voted an annuity of £6,000 to the Duchess, for the maintenance and
    education of her child, and this was subsequently increased after the
    accession of William IV.</p>

  <p>The upbringing of her daughter became her absorbing occupation, and,
    shutting herself up in Kensington Palace, she devoted herself to the
    child’s education.</p>

  <p>The lessons of Princess Victoria’s childhood were superintended by the
    Dean of Chester. Her education, judged by the standards of to-day,
    was not of an exceptionally high order. It would be interesting to
    know what old Roger Ascham would have thought of the Dean of Chester’s
    curriculum. So far as can be gathered from her own childish records
    and from the correspondence and memoirs of those who had access to
    Kensington, she was taught the ordinary things which children are
    supposed to learn. Fortunately, perhaps, no effort of any special
    kind was made to train her mind or mould her character, with a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>view
    to the responsibilities which lay before her or to the position she
    appeared destined to fill. When, at a later stage, the Bishops of
    London and Lincoln were requested to draw up a report, for presentation
    to Parliament, upon her moral and intellectual attainments, they
    found no difficulty in giving credit to the Duchess of Kent for the
    conscientious manner in which she had endeavoured to educate the
    heiress to the Throne. We may, however, take leave to doubt whether
    those entrusted with the Princess’s education were teachers endowed
    with any special aptitudes; and it is certain that the outlook of
    the Duchess herself, although practical and wise, was not of that
    discerning character which enabled her to differentiate between a
    commonplace education and its more subtle forms. It was precisely what
    might have been expected from one whose youth had been spent in a small
    German Court, and whose later opportunities had not brought her into
    contact with highly trained and thoughtful minds.</p>

  <p>A foreign observer and critic once suggested a doubt whether the Queen
    could have maintained through life her admirable mental equilibrium if
    education had developed in her high intellectual curiosity or fantastic
    imagination. It is an interesting speculation. Soundness of judgment
    possibly rests upon the receptive rather than upon the creative
    faculties, and upon physical rather than upon intellectual activities.
    It may, as has been said, require a rare type of intelligence—that of
    Disraeli—to combine ideas and dreams with the realities of public life.
    In the domain of learning, Queen <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>Victoria had very little in common
    with Elizabeth or with any Sovereign of the Renaissance. Her mother and
    the worthy Dean, who watched over her youth, were content to foster the
    quality of good sense, and to inculcate high standards of private and
    public virtue. Her future subjects, could they have been consulted,
    would have strongly approved. In after-years the English middle-class
    recognised in the Queen a certain strain of German sentimentality which
    they affectionately condoned, and a robust equilibrium of mind which
    they thoroughly admired.</p>

  <p>It is as well, therefore, that events took the shape they did, and
    that the mind and character of the Princess were trained upon simple
    lines in accordance with the practice of the average citizen families
    subsequently to be her subjects. In years to come the Queen was perhaps
    better able to look at events and persons from the point of view
    of the majority of her people than would have been possible if her
    education had given her a high place among the intellectuals. It was a
    saving grace throughout her long reign that while she could recognise
    intellect and capacity, her sympathies were with average people, whose
    feelings and opinions she more readily understood and in reality
    represented.</p>

  <p>In these days, when Accomplishments, as they were called in the first
    half of the nineteenth century, are no longer esteemed in young people,
    and their place has been usurped by athletic exercises, it is difficult
    to describe, in a way that appeals to the serious imagination, the
    girlish tastes of Princess <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>Victoria. Perhaps the world has not lost
    much because young ladies to-day learn to play golf and have ceased to
    sing duets.</p>

  <p>In the thirties, music and painting and a knowledge of modern languages
    were the necessary equipment of a girl destined to move in Society.
    It mattered little how reedy and small the voice, she was expected to
    vocalise like Grisi and to sing duets with Mario.</p>

  <p>The Queen had been well trained musically, according to the lights
    of those days. She could appreciate the simpler forms of melody,
    especially Italian opera, while she could sing and play sufficiently
    well to give much pleasure to herself and mild pleasure to others. As a
    linguist, as a reader, and as a writer of letters and memoranda she had
    no pretensions to pre-eminence; but she could speak modern languages as
    well as any Queen is called upon to do, she could read and appreciate
    high literature, although not without effort, and she could express
    herself with pungency and vigour, although not with any marked literary
    skill or distinction of style.</p>

  <p>Her drawings and water-colour sketches were through life a constant
    source of happiness to the Queen. There are at Windsor literally
    hundreds of small sketch-books, containing reminiscences of her
    journeys and sojournings in Scotland and in Italy, again not of high
    artistic merit, but sufficiently vital to suggest the reflection that
    a young lady of to-day is possibly no gainer by having substituted the
    golf-club for the pencil.</p>

  <p>The Queen’s teachers were excellent, commonplace <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>people, and they
    left precisely those traces on her mind that might have been expected.
    Her character was another matter. They could not and did not influence
    that, and it is the character of the Queen that places her in the small
    category of rulers who have not only deserved well of their country,
    but have left an indelible stamp upon the life of their people.</p>

  <h3>III</h3>

  <p>These Journals were commenced in the year 1832, a year memorable in our
    history for the fruition of hopes deeply cherished by the political
    party that had arisen, under the auspices of Canning, after the close
    of the struggle with Napoleon.</p>

  <p>During the year when the first Reform Bill became the law of the land,
    the passions of men had been deeply stirred throughout Great Britain.
    The political struggle, begun seventeen years before, had come to a
    head. The classes still paramount had found themselves face to face
    with the desires and aspirations of classes hitherto subordinate to
    have a share in the government of the country. These feelings had grown
    fiercer year by year, and, encouraged by the Whig party headed by
    Earl Grey, had found ultimate expression in the Reform Bill of 1832,
    framed under the ægis of that Minister. All over Europe the stream of
    change and reform, loosed by the French Revolution and subsequently
    checked by the Congress of Vienna, began once more to flow. During the
    sixteen years that followed Princess <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>Victoria’s first entry in these
    Journals, the waters of Revolution had flooded Europe. Thrones and
    institutions in every European country were shaken, many of them to
    their foundations, and some with disastrous results. Fortunately for
    Great Britain, her statesmen had anticipated the events of 1848, and
    the Reform Bill had so far satisfied the aspirations of the hitherto
    unenfranchised classes as to render innocuous the frothing of agitators
    during that tragic year of revolution. In aptitude for anticipating
    social and political change and avoiding violent manifestations of
    popular will, the English race stands pre-eminent. Our people as well
    as our statesmen have from the earliest times proved themselves to
    be experts in the art of government, and the history of Europe is a
    commentary upon that gift of the British nation.</p>

  <p>There have, of course, been moments when the atmosphere of politics
    has been highly charged with electricity. Such a moment occurred in
    1832. A storm broke with unusual violence over the head of William IV.
    The House of Lords was bitterly hostile to a Bill, accepted by the
    House of Commons and supported with enthusiasm by the majority of his
    subjects. There was no machinery existing under the Constitution for
    adjusting these differences except that of creating a sufficient number
    of Peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill through the House of
    Lords. The King therefore found himself in the unpleasant position of
    having to place his prerogative of creating peers in the hands of his
    Ministers, or else by his own act to dispense with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>their services.
    The choice found him undecided and left him baffled. He was not acute
    enough to see that in the existing state of public opinion he had no
    choice. If he had possessed wit to read the signs of the times, it is
    doubtful whether he would have had sufficient single-minded courage to
    take immediate action in accordance with the opinion he had formed.
    Penetrating vision the King lacked, and responsibility was distasteful
    to him. Consequently he was not only weak, but he showed weakness.
    It was clear that the Government of Lord Grey held unimpaired the
    confidence of the House of Commons and possessed the full approval of
    the country. Every intelligent observer realised that the Reform Bill,
    in spite of its aristocratic foes, in spite of the prophets of evil,
    and in spite of its inherent defects, was bound to be passed into law.
    King William, however, conceived it to be his duty to endeavour to
    find an alternative Government. It was as certain as anything could
    be in politics, that Sir Robert Peel would not, and that the Duke of
    Wellington could not, come to his assistance. There was something
    pitiful about the spectacle of the old sailor-King casting about for a
    safe anchorage, and finding one cable parting after another. Security
    was only to be found in the Ministers who had advised him, in the last
    resort, to use his prerogative for the purpose of swamping a majority
    in the House of Lords that hesitated to bow to the will of the people.
    Ultimately he was constrained to accept their advice, but it was only
    after a loss of personal dignity and a distinct weakening of the
    authority of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>Crown. The King, men said, had touted about to find
    Ministers to serve him, and had failed to find them. This humiliation,
    at least, King William might have avoided, had he possessed a clearer
    vision of possibilities and greater firmness of character.</p>

  <p>The political storms of 1832 appear to have broken noiselessly against
    the walls of Kensington Palace, for in the little Princess’s Journals
    there is no sign that she was aware of them. The King’s worries,
    however, so affected his temper, that it was impossible for the
    Princess and her mother not to feel its reflex action. In the Journals
    no mention is made of the domestic troubles which have been described
    elsewhere, and we know, from expressions of Queen Victoria’s in later
    years, that she had purposely refrained, in compiling her Journals,
    from referring to her mother’s worries and her own.</p>

  <p>During the four years that immediately preceded Princess Victoria’s
    accession to the Throne, from 1832 to 1836, these Journals give us
    the picture of a young life passed amid the tranquil surroundings of
    Kensington Palace, its educational monotony only varied by attendance
    at the opera or the theatre, by autumnal trips into the provinces,
    or by welcome visits from foreign cousins. These autumnal trips were
    the “royal progresses,” as he called them, against which King William
    was wont to protest in vehement language. They evidently gave intense
    pleasure to the Princess. Her Journals contain records of them all.
    Some examples have been given, in these extracts, of her method of
    describing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>her visits to provincial cities and towns, to seaside
    summer resorts, and to a few of the great homes of those who were
    afterwards to be her Ministers or subjects.</p>

  <p>It was during this period that she got her first glimpse of the Isle
    of Wight, where so much of her life was afterwards to be spent. The
    fact that Sir John Conroy, whom she disliked, lived for many years
    at Osborne Lodge seems not to have prevented her from subsequently
    becoming deeply attached to that quiet home amid beautiful surroundings
    created by her and Prince Albert upon the site where Osborne Lodge had
    stood. Whippingham Church, to be so closely connected with her and her
    children, was first visited in the year 1833.</p>

  <p>Enough has been included in these extracts to show her liking for the
    opera and for the theatre, her pleasure in music, her devotion to the
    pursuit of riding, and that love for animals which characterised her
    through life.</p>

  <p>When she was sixteen she went to Ascot for the first time, and
    figured in the royal procession. It began to be recognised that the
    young Princess had passed the threshold of girlhood. In that year
    her Confirmation took place at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, and
    Archbishop Howley, believed to be the last prelate who wore a wig,
    officiated. During the autumn she visited Yorkshire and stayed with
    Archbishop Harcourt at Bishopthorpe and with Lord Fitzwilliam at
    Wentworth. Coming south, she was the guest of the Duke of Rutland at
    Belvoir, of Lord Exeter at Burghley, and of Lord Leicester <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>at Holkham.
    In the following year, 1836, she met for the first time her cousin
    Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. He and his elder brother Ernest visited
    Kensington Palace at the instance of her uncle Leopold. The fact that
    Prince Albert had been thought of years before by the King of the
    Belgians as a possible husband for Princess Victoria was sufficient
    to set King William IV. against the match. The King, however, was not
    uncivil to the brothers when they visited London, but he had ideas of
    his own about the future of his niece, and he tried hard to lay the
    foundations of an alliance between the young Princess and the younger
    son of the Prince of Orange. Prince Albert on this occasion made no
    deep impression upon Princess Victoria’s mind or heart, but her loyalty
    to her uncle Leopold and her regard for his opinion led her to show
    the graceful young Coburg Prince marked preference over the somewhat
    ungainly candidate of King William. Her heart was clearly untouched,
    but she was willing to be guided by the advice of that counsellor and
    friend to whom in preference to every one she had already begun to
    turn for help and guidance. As this became obvious to King William,
    his jealousy and dislike for the Duchess of Kent increased; and in the
    autumn of this year, 1836, having invited his sister-in-law to a state
    banquet, he scandalised Society by delivering an after-dinner speech
    charged with recrimination and insult to his guest.</p>

  <p>This was the Princess’s penultimate year as a minor. King William had
    for a long time been haunted with the fear that he would die before his
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>niece came of age, and that a regency would devolve upon his hated
    sister-in-law. He was spared what he would have considered this final
    humiliation, for on May 24, 1837, the young Princess came of age, just
    a month before the King died at Windsor.</p>

  <p>During the final years of her minority she was thrown freely into the
    society of many of the eminent and distinguished persons soon to be her
    subjects. The Duchess gave a series of entertainments at Kensington
    Palace, and the Princess was brought into contact with her mother’s
    guests. Accounts of these dinners and concerts, and full lists of the
    guests, are all minutely recorded in the Journals. Comments, however,
    beyond an occasional expression of delight at the music and admiration
    for its performers, are excluded. Her life was still the life of a
    child, and her days were mostly spent with her preceptors, under the
    auspices of the Duchess of Northumberland, her official governess, and
    of the Dean of Chester, her tutor.</p>

  <p>She had been parted some years before from her half brother and sister
    by the usual exigencies of time. Prince Charles of Leiningen had become
    a sea-officer, and Princess Feodore was married. Into the inner orbit
    of her young life there penetrated only Sir John Conroy, whose person
    was odious to her, and Baroness Lehzen, the daughter of a Hanoverian
    clergyman, who had been the Princess’s governess since 1824, and to
    whom she was deeply attached. Lablache, her singing-master, a man of
    some originality and charm, was a constant source of interest <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>and
    amusement to the young Princess, and she preferred his lessons to all
    others.</p>

  <p>It was during these last few years before her accession that the final
    touches were given to her character by the subtle influences of her
    environment. The position occupied by Sir John Conroy in her mother’s
    house inspired and fortified her subsequent resolve to avoid intimacies
    with members of her household. She became distant and reserved to
    those about her, and her relations with her mother were chilled. Her
    mind acquired an impression that family ties, however binding from the
    point of view of duty, might be superseded by those of friendship. It
    is undoubtedly the case that Baroness Lehzen occupied at this time
    the first place in her pupil’s thoughts and affections; while the
    dawning necessity felt by Princess Victoria for sympathy, and for those
    intimate communings so attractive to sentimental natures, had a very
    distinct influence upon the mind and conduct of the Queen in subsequent
    years. Her Journals afford proof, if proof had been wanting, that, in
    spite of the opinions of her attainments vouchsafed by eminent clerics,
    the Princess had not been afforded an education specially designed to
    fit her for the situation she was to occupy.</p>

  <p>She was, at eighteen, as moderately and indifferently equipped as the
    average girl of her age. If her conversation was not brilliant, her
    heart was kindly and her judgment sound. She was shrewd and eminently
    truthful. In spite of her small stature, she was curiously dignified
    and impressive. Her voice was musical and carried far. And above <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>all
    things, her rectitude was unassailable, and her sense of duty so
    keen and high that it supplied any lack of imagination or spiritual
    deficiency. She was humble-minded, but not, perhaps, very tender. She
    was passionate and imperious, but always faithful. She was supremely
    conscious of the responsibilities and prerogatives of her calling,
    which she was convinced, then and always, were her appanage by the gift
    of God.</p>

  <p>There is nothing in her Journals or elsewhere to show that before she
    was eighteen years old she had ever talked seriously and at any length
    to any man or woman of exceptional gifts. It was only when her uncle
    King Leopold heard of the illness of William IV. that Stockmar was
    instructed to speak with due gravity upon important matters to the
    young girl whose accession to the Throne appeared imminent. Her mind
    at that time was a blank page in so far as questions of high politics
    or of administration were concerned. In point of fact, this was a
    fortunate circumstance, and rendered easier the task of those who were
    bound in the nature of things, and under the constitution of these
    islands, to use this youthful Princess as one of the chief instruments
    of government. Her mind was free from any political bias or complexion,
    and ready to receive the impress of her constitutional Ministers. When,
    within less than a month of her eighteenth birthday, King William
    died, and when on June 20, 1837, the Queen found herself face to face
    with those Whig statesmen in whose hands the destinies of the country
    had been placed for the time being, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>their task was unhampered by
    preconceived ideas or by foregone prejudice in their pupil. For the
    Queen a new chapter of life was opened. She at once threw off the
    trammels of pupilage. Not only was she able immediately and without
    effort to shake herself clear of the domestic influences she had
    resented and disliked, but for the first time she was enabled to meet
    and to question distinguished men, with whose names she was familiar,
    but whose standards of thought and conversation were far higher than
    any to which she had been accustomed.</p>

  <p>It was “in a palace in a garden, meet scene for youth and innocence,”
    as one in later years to be her favoured Minister wrote, that Princess
    Victoria received the news of her accession to a Throne overlooking
    “every sea and nations in every zone.” The scene and the circumstances
    in which her accession was announced to her by the Archbishop of
    Canterbury and Lord Conynghame are described by the Queen in her
    Journal. She has also recorded her impressions of what followed when
    for the first time she met the Privy Council. What the Queen has not
    described is the effect produced upon those present by her personality,
    her youthful charm, her self-possession and perfect modesty, in such
    strong contrast to everything which her Privy Councillors had been
    accustomed to find in their former Sovereigns. The Queen was not
    aware of the interest <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>and curiosity she then excited in the minds of
    her subjects. She had been brought up in such comparative seclusion,
    that both to “Society” and to the great world outside her character
    was an enigma and even her appearance very little known. Her sex and
    youth rendered her personality exciting to a public satiated with the
    elderly vagaries of her uncles. It was noticed at her first Council
    that her manner was very graceful and engaging. It was particularly
    observed that after she had read her speech in a clear and singularly
    firm voice, when the two surviving sons of George III., the Dukes of
    Cumberland and Sussex, knelt before her, swearing allegiance, she
    blushed up to the eyes as if she felt the contrast between their public
    and private relations, between their august age and her inexperienced
    youth. It was also noticed that she spoke to no one, and that not the
    smallest difference in her manner could be detected, even by sharp
    watching eyes, between her attitude towards Lord Melbourne and the
    Ministers on the one hand, and towards the Duke of Wellington and Sir
    Robert Peel on the other. The Queen does not mention, for she was not
    then aware of it, that Lord Melbourne was charmed and Sir Robert Peel
    amazed at her demeanour. They spoke afterwards with emotion of her
    modesty, firmness, and evident deep sense of her situation. She did not
    know then, although she knew later, that the Duke of Wellington said
    that had she been his own daughter he could not have desired to see her
    perform her part better.</p>

  <p>These Journals only accentuate what is already <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>known from many
    sources, that the Queen showed in difficult circumstances not only
    good taste and good feeling, but admirable good sense. Her attention
    to details, which some might consider trifles, but which differentiate
    the careful from the thoughtless mind, was noticed with approval and
    surprise by her Ministers. She exhibited caution in her treatment of
    those persons who had been about her since childhood, and she made
    no appeal to any of them for advice or guidance. Nor did she permit
    advice to be proffered. Sir John Conroy was dismissed at once from
    her surroundings. Baroness Lehzen she retained, as before, about
    her person, and she speaks of her, throughout these Journals, with
    deep feeling. It was noticed, whenever she was asked to decide some
    difficult matter, her customary reply was that she would think it over,
    and give her answer on the morrow. Onlookers, knowing that she relied
    on the advice of Lord Melbourne, generally assumed that she referred
    to him in the interval. He, however, declared that to many of his
    questions a similar reply was given. In point of fact, she was obeying
    one of the precepts of her uncle, the King of the Belgians.</p>

  <p>It will be obvious to the readers of this book that a potent influence
    over the mind and actions of the young Queen was exercised by Lord
    Melbourne. It was the natural outcome of the business relation between
    a very charming and experienced man of the world who happened to be
    her Prime Minister and a very young girl isolated in the solitary
    atmosphere of the Throne. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>From the Queen’s accession to the day of
    her marriage the table-talk of Lord Melbourne fills the largest space
    in her journals. Her description of their intercourse confirms what we
    know from other sources, that Lord Melbourne became absorbed by the
    novel and striking duty that had fallen to his lot. His temperament and
    his antecedents rendered him peculiarly sensitive to the fascinating
    influences of the strange relation in which he stood to this young
    Queen. Lord Melbourne’s life had been chequered by curious experiences,
    and his mind had been thoroughly well trained, for a man of his
    station, according to the lights of those days. A classical education,
    the privilege from youth upwards of free intercourse with every one
    worth knowing, the best Whig connection, and an inherited capacity for
    governing men under oligarchic institutions, had equipped his intellect
    and judgment with everything that was necessary to enable him carefully
    to watch and safeguard the blossoming of the character of the girl who
    was both his pupil and his Sovereign.</p>

  <p>He was no longer young, but he was not old. His person was attractive.
    According to Leslie, no mean judge, his head was a truly noble one,
    and he was a fine specimen of manly beauty in the meridian of life.
    Not only were his features handsome, but his expression was in the
    highest degree intellectual. His laugh was frequent and the most joyous
    possible, his voice so deep and musical that to hear him say the most
    ordinary thing was a pleasure; and his frankness, his freedom from
    affectation, and his peculiar humour rendered almost everything he
    said, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>however easy and natural, quite original. Chantrey’s bust and
    the well-known portraits of Melbourne corroborate the descriptions
    given by his contemporaries.</p>

  <p>The Queen’s Journals afford us some illustrations of the extent of
    his memory and reading. In his knowledge of political history he was
    unsurpassed by any living Englishman, and among the statesmen of that
    day there were none by age, character, and experience so well qualified
    for the task of making the Queen acquainted with the art of government,
    or better able to give her a correct interpretation of the laws and
    spirit of the constitution. He understood perfectly the importance
    of training her to work straightforwardly but secretly with that
    small committee of active politicians, representing the parliamentary
    majority of the day, which goes by the name of the Cabinet. Sir Robert
    Peel and the Duke of Wellington, the Leaders of the Opposition, felt
    and admitted that for her initiation into the mysteries of Kingcraft,
    the Queen could not have been in wiser hands. It will be obvious from
    these Journals that the Queen drifted into political partisanship.
    She lived in dread of losing her Whig Ministers, and she got “to
    hate” the Tories. This only meant—and under all the circumstances it
    was natural—that she ardently desired to retain her mentor at her
    side. It is to the credit of Lord Melbourne that he was constantly
    discouraging his Sovereign’s bias towards the Whig Party, of which he
    was the head, and that he never lost an opportunity of smoothing the
    way for the advent of Sir Robert Peel which he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>knew to be inevitable.
    He was, not inaptly, called a Regius Professor with no professorial
    disqualifications, and it was precisely from this point of view that
    the Tory leaders recognised the indispensable nature of his task, and
    approved his manner of performing it. He was a Whig no doubt, says his
    biographer, but at any rate he was an honest-hearted Englishman, and,
    in no merely conventional sense, a gentleman on whose perfect honour no
    one hesitated to place reliance.</p>

  <p>He treated the Queen with unbounded consideration and respect, yet he
    did not hesitate to administer reproof. He consulted her tastes and her
    wishes, but he checked her inclination to be headstrong and arbitrary.
    He knew well how to chide with parental firmness, but he did so with a
    deference that could not fail to fascinate any young girl in a man of
    his age and attainments. The Queen was completely under his charm. The
    ease of his frank and natural manners, his quaint epigrams and humorous
    paradox, his romantic bias and worldly shrewdness, were magnified by
    her into the noblest manly virtues.</p>

  <p>He saw her every day, but never appeared to weary of her society.
    She certainly never tired of his. Yet he was fifty-eight years old,
    a time-worn politician, and she was a girl of eighteen. He was her
    confidential servant and at the same time her guardian. She was his
    ward and at the same time his Sovereign. The situation was full of the
    possibilities of drama, yet nothing can be more delightful than the
    high comedy revealed in the passages of the Journals that refer to Lord
    Melbourne. That <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>he should have happened to be First Minister of the
    Crown when King William died was a rare piece of good fortune for the
    new Sovereign and for the country. With all the immense powers of head
    and heart which the Queen came later to discover in Sir Robert Peel,
    we may take leave to doubt if he could so lightly and so wisely have
    assumed and fulfilled the duties imposed upon his predecessor.</p>

  <p>It is impossible to exaggerate the effect produced upon the mind and
    character of the Queen by the apostolic letters of her uncle. Even the
    sound constitutional dogma of Stockmar might have failed to influence
    one naturally inclined to be autocratic. Those, however, who were to
    reap the profit in later years of the shrewd daily culture of the
    Queen’s mind, of the skilful pruning away of ideas dangerous in a
    British Sovereign, of the respectful explanation of her duties, of the
    humorous rallying upon slight weaknesses which might have developed
    into awkward habits, were deeply indebted, as these Journals show, to
    the sagacity of Lord Melbourne.</p>

  <h3>V</h3>

  <p>Two Queens Regnant, Queen Mary and Queen Anne, both of Stewart blood,
    lived much at Kensington Palace, and both died there. As a place of
    residence it had no attractions for the Sovereigns of the House of
    Hanover. Queen Victoria was fond of the old wing in which her youth had
    been spent, and which was subsequently occupied for many years <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>by the
    Duchess of Teck and her children. Built on piles, those portions of the
    Palace that were uninhabited, and therefore indifferently looked after,
    had towards the end of the Queen’s reign fallen into such disrepair
    that their demolition had been decided by the Treasury. The Queen
    disliked intensely the idea of removing any part of the old building.
    Ultimately a bargain was made with the Chancellor of the Exchequer of
    the day. It involved a certain exchange of houses in the gift of the
    Crown and some shifting of financial responsibility. Kensington Palace
    was saved, and a considerable sum was voted by Parliament for its
    restoration, on condition that the public should be admitted to certain
    rooms of historic interest.</p>

  <p>King George’s dream, and no one knows better its visionary character,
    is to pull down Buckingham Palace, to round off St. James’s and the
    Green Parks at Constitution Hill and Buckingham Gate, and then, with
    the money obtained by the sale of the Gardens of Buckingham Palace, to
    reconstruct Kensington Palace as the town residence of the Sovereign.</p>

  <p>For Queen Mary the place is full of memories and, because of her keen
    historic sense, full of interest.</p>

  <p>Compared with most of the great European capitals, London is poor in
    palaces. The homes of the Tudor Sovereigns in and near the metropolis,
    Nonsuch, Greenwich, and Whitehall, have disappeared. London contains
    no single palace residentially associated with our long line of
    Sovereigns. The Court of St. James was housed, in the eighteenth
    century, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>in the Palace of that name. It seems to have been adequate
    for the needs of the Hanoverian Princes, who had none of the amplitude
    of the Tudors or the fine taste of the Stewarts.</p>

  <p>The memories of Windsor, however, are long memories. Although Queen
    Victoria never liked Windsor, perhaps because she was never in good
    health there, it is with Windsor Castle that the principal events
    of her reign are associated. The thoughts of the few, the very few,
    comparatively speaking, of her subjects who were admitted to the
    seclusion of Court life during two-thirds of the Queen’s reign may
    carry them back to quiet days at Balmoral or Osborne, but it was round
    Windsor that the political interest of the Victorian era centred. There
    the links of the chain have remained unsevered between the Sovereigns
    of Great Britain to-day and their Plantagenet ancestors.</p>

  <p>If the Queen’s attachment to Windsor was not deep, she was more
    indifferent still to Buckingham Palace. There is not a word in her
    Diaries or correspondence to show that she in any way looked upon it as
    a home or even a residence in any degree interesting or attractive. No
    attempt was made, after the death of the Prince Consort, to improve or
    beautify it. The magnificent objects of art and the splendid collection
    of pictures were badly displayed and quite unappreciated. Few, outside
    the circle of the Court, knew of their existence. The Palace was judged
    by its mean façade, and the nation was rather shamefaced about the home
    of its Sovereign, and certainly took no credit for the really <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>noble
    rooms and their contents which Buckingham Palace contains.</p>

  <p>Yet, through the picture-gallery of this Palace hung with masterpieces
    of the Dutch School, through the throne-room and the drawing-room
    resplendent with the royal portraits of Reynolds and Gainsborough, or
    through the matchless corridor at Windsor, have passed nearly all the
    great figures of the nineteenth century, practically the whole of which
    was spanned by the life of the Queen.</p>

  <p>It is an imposing array, worthy of its setting. Heroes and statesmen,
    men of science and letters, artists and scholars, all moved, with
    a feeling of awe, into the presence of the Queen whose girlhood is
    recounted by herself in these pages.</p>

  <p>To those accustomed to the easier manners of more recent times it is
    difficult to convey a sense of the atmosphere of Windsor during the
    reign of the Queen. Her extraordinary aloofness was its determining
    cause, but the effect was that of a shrine. Grave men walked softly
    through the rooms of the Castle, and no voice was ever raised. The
    presence of the Sovereign brooded, so to speak, over the Palace and
    its environment. The desire to be negligently at ease never entered
    the mind. The air was rarefied by a feeling that somewhere, in a
    region unvisited by any but the most highly privileged, was seated,
    not in an ordinary arm-chair, but on a throne, the awe-inspiring
    and ever-dignified figure of the Sovereign. The proud intellect of
    Gladstone and the rugged self-sufficiency of Bright bent before the
    small, homely figure in widow’s weeds. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>In spite of this homeliness of
    appearance, notwithstanding her love of simplicity and her dislike of
    tawdriness and display, her spirit never put aside the regal habit.
    How rarely the Queen extended her hand! It was a great privilege, and
    only on special occasions vouchsafed to her Ministers. Men and women
    bent very low to kiss that hand. This was not due to her small stature,
    but to the curious, indefinable awe that she undoubtedly inspired
    during the later portion of her life in all who approached her. Will
    the reader find, in these records of her girlhood, intimations of that
    moral ascendency she afterwards acquired over her subjects?</p>

  <p>It was unquestionably a triumph of character. Even now to attempt a
    serious estimate of the intellectual capacity of Queen Victoria is a
    difficult task. There are too many still among us the greater part of
    whose lives were spent under her sway. It is a fault in nearly all
    recent biographies that they attempt appreciations which only the lapse
    of time can enable a writer to draw in true perspective.</p>

  <p>A venerable Sovereign, in full possession of his great powers of
    intellect and character, who was almost an exact contemporary, still
    rules a European people as proud of him as were her subjects of the
    Queen. At least one of her faithful servants, who was present at
    her Coronation seventy-four years ago and at every great ceremonial
    throughout her reign, is still alive and full of manly vigour. Her
    children are in the prime of life, and her favourite grandson is the
    beloved Sovereign of the people she governed. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>Unqualified praise is
    always distasteful, and critical analysis may easily prove to be in
    singularly bad taste. Queen Victoria’s womanly and royal virtues are
    written in golden letters upon the face of the vast Empire over which
    she reigned. Her faults may well lie buried, for some time yet, in her
    grave under the shadow of Windsor.</p>

  <p>In the muniment-room of the Castle are preserved the private records of
    her life-work. Over a thousand bound volumes of letters, from and to
    the Queen upon all subjects, public and domestic, are there; and over a
    hundred volumes of her Journals written in her own hand.</p>

  <p>It is a unique record. The private papers of George III. have
    disappeared. Of those of George IV. and William IV., only a few are in
    existence. Selections from the correspondence of the Queen up to 1861
    were published by permission of King Edward. These selections from her
    early Journals have been made by the gracious leave of King George. It
    may be many years before it would be wise or prudent to make public
    any more of the private history of Queen Victoria’s reign. Those who,
    by good fortune, have had access to these records can, however, safely
    predict that whatever hereafter leaps to light, the Queen never can be
    shamed.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Queen’s Journal opens she was thirteen years and two
      months old. When she was four years younger Sir Walter Scott was
      presented to the little Princess Victoria and noted that she was
      “educating with much care.” At that time she was supposed not to
      know that she was the “heir of England,” but Scott thought that
      if the little heart could be dissected it would be found that
      some little bird had carried the matter. According to Baroness
      Lehzen, the truth was not revealed until a year before the Princess
      commenced to write her first Journal. There was a picture painted
      of her about this time, and it corroborates Lord Albemarle’s
      description of the little girl of extreme fairness whom he watched
      watering, at Kensington, a child’s garden, wearing a large straw
      hat and a suit of white cotton, her only ornament being a coloured
      fichu round the neck.</p>

    <p>The Princess was guarded with extreme care. Leigh Hunt noticed that
      she was invariably followed, when walking, by a footman in gorgeous
      raiment. She told her daughters many years later that she was so
      carefully tended until the day of her accession, that she had never
      been permitted to walk downstairs without someone holding her hand.</p>

    <p>The Princess’s journey commenced August 1, 1832, although the first
      part of what her Uncle, King William, called her Royal Progresses
      was not her first trip into the country. With her mother she paid
      several visits to Ramsgate and Broadstairs. She had stayed with
      Lord Winchelsea at Eastwell, near Ashford, and she had visited
      George IV. at the Royal Lodge in Windsor Park. She had spent an
      autumn at Norris Castle, Isle of Wight, and had been to Bath and
      Malvern.</p>

    <p>Sir Walter Scott expressed a hope that she would not retain the
      name of Victoria, and when upon the accession of William IV. extra
      provision was demanded of Parliament for the little Princess
      Alexandrina Victoria of Kent, who then became heir-presumptive to
      the Crown, Sir Matthew White Ridley and Sir Robert Inglis desired
      to make the Parliamentary grant contingent upon the Princess, as
      Queen, assuming the style of Elizabeth II., on the ground that the
      name Victoria did not accord with the feelings of the people. The
      name Victoria, however, was destined to acquire lustre not inferior
      to that of Elizabeth.</p>

    <p>The Princess’s first Progress is minutely described in the first
      volume of her Journal. Before it ended, Robert Lowe, afterwards
      her Chancellor of the Exchequer, caught a glimpse of the child as
      she passed from the Bodleian to lunch with the Vice-Chancellor at
      Oxford. Her foot was on the threshold of public life.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER I<br>1832</div>

  <p><i>Wednesday, August 1st.</i> We left K.P.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> at 6 minutes past 7 and
    went through the Lower-field gate to the right. We went on, &amp; turned
    to the left by the new road to Regent’s Park. The road &amp; scenery is
    beautiful. 20 minutes to 9. We have just changed horses at Barnet, a
    very pretty little town. 5 minutes past ½ past 9. We have just changed
    horses at St. Albans. The situation is very pretty &amp; there is a
    beautiful old abbey there. 5 minutes past 10. The country is beautiful
    here: they have began to cut the corn; it is so golden &amp; fine that I
    think they will have a very good harvest, at least here. There are also
    pretty hills &amp; trees. 20 minutes past ten. We have just passed a most
    beautiful old house in a fine park with splendid trees. A ¼ to 11. We
    have just changed horses at Dunstable; there was a fair there; the
    booths filled with fruit, ribbons, &amp;c. looked very pretty. The town
    seems old &amp; there is a fine abbey before it. The country is very bleak
    &amp; chalky. 12 minutes to 12. We have just changed horses at Brickhill.
    The country is very beautiful about here. 19 minutes to 1. We have
    just changed horses at Stony Stratford. The country is very pretty.
    About ½ past 1 o’clock we arrived at Towcester &amp; lunched there. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>At 14
    minutes past two we left it. A ¼ past 3. We have just changed horses
    at Daventry. The road continues to be very dusty. 1 minute past ½ past
    3. We have just<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> passed through Braunston where there is a curious
    spire. The Oxford canal is close to the town. 1 minute to 4. We have
    just changed horses at Dunchurch &amp; it is raining.</p>

  <p>For some time past already, and now, our road is entirely up an avenue
    of trees going on and on, it is quite delightful but it still rains.
    Just now we go at a <em>tremendous</em> rate. 4 minutes to 5. We have
    just changed horses at Coventry, a large town where there is a very old
    church (in appearance at least). At ½ past 5 we arrived at Meridon; and
    we are now going to dress for dinner. ½ past 8. I am undressing to go
    to bed. Mamma is not well and is lying on the sofa in the next room. I
    was asleep in a minute in my own little bed which travels always with
    me.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 2d August.</i>—I got up after a very good night at 5
    o’clock this morning. Mamma is much better I am happy to say, and I
    am now dressing to go to breakfast. 6 minutes to ½ past 7. We have
    just left Meridon, a very clean inn. It is a very bad day. 10 minutes
    to 9. We have just changed horses at Birmingham where I was two years
    ago and we visited the manufactories which are very curious. It rains
    very hard. We just passed through a town where all coal mines are and
    you see the fire glimmer at a distance in the engines in many places.
    The men, women, children, country and houses are all black. But I can
    not by any description give an idea of its strange and extraordinary
    appearance. The country is very desolate every where; there are coals
    about, and the grass <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>is quite blasted and black. I just now see an
    extraordinary building flaming with fire. The country continues black,
    engines flaming, coals, in abundance, every where, smoking and burning
    coal heaps, intermingled with wretched huts and carts and little ragged
    children....</p>

  <p>I received from the mayor an oaken box with a silver top and filled
    with the famous Shrewsbury cakes. We lunched there. We left it at a ¼
    to 3. As we passed along the streets a poor unhappy hen, frightened
    by the noise flew on the carriage but she was taken off. We had our
    horses watered half way. When we arrived at the outskirts of Welshpool
    we were met by a troop of Yeomanry who escorted us for a long time and
    the little town was ornamented with arches, flowers, branches, flags,
    ribbons, &amp;c., &amp;c. The guns fired as we came up the park and the band
    played before Powis Castle; Lord Powis[5] and Mr. Clive met us at the
    door of his beautiful old Castle and Lady Lucy and Lady Harriet Clive
    were in the gallery. The Castle is very old and beautiful; the little
    old windows jutting in and out and a fine gallery with a dry-rubbed
    floor and some beautiful busts. I am now dressing for dinner....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 9th August.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7.
    I am now dressing. A little after 8 I went out in the garden, and
    at about ¼ to 9 we took breakfast. I began to write a letter after
    breakfast, and then dressed. At ½ past 10 Mamma <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>received an address
    from the Mayor and Corporation of Beaumaris, and another from the
    gentlemen inhabitants, and visitors of the town. At ½ past 11 we got
    into our carriages with my Cousins on the box of ours. In passing
    the Menai-bridge, we received a salute, and on entering the town
    of Carnarvon, we were met, not only by an immense crowd, who were
    extremely kind, and pleased, but by the Corporation also, who walked
    before the carriage, while a salute was firing. We then arrived at
    the inn, where Mamma received an address. The address being over we
    took luncheon, and after that was over, we went to see the ruins of
    the Castle, which are beautiful, while a salute was fired, from the
    rampart. We then got into the <em>Emerald</em>, where we were several
    times saluted, at the last being nearly becalmed, we were towed by a
    steam packet, called <cite>Paul Pry</cite>, which saluted us 4 times in the
    day. We arrived at home at ¼ to 7, and dined at ½ past 7. We drank
    Uncle Leopold’s health in honour of his marriage that day. I stayed up
    till ½ past 9. I went to bed soon after, and was soon asleep....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 29th August.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7.
    It is now 6 minutes past 8 &amp; I am quite ready dressed. I then played.
    We breakfasted at ½ past 8 but without Lady Catherine<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> who is very
    unwell. I then did my lessons &amp; then played. At ½ past 12 I went
    out walking. We lunched at 1. At ½ past 3 went to Baron Hill Sir R.
    Bulkeley’s<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> place. We arrived there at a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>little after 4. We were
    received at the door by Sir Richard &amp; farther on by Lady Bulkeley whose
    dress I shall describe. It was a white satin trimmed with blonde, short
    sleeves &amp; a necklace, ear-rings and sévigné of perridos &amp; diamonds with
    a wreath of orange-flowers in her hair. We then went upon the terrace
    &amp; the band of the Anglesea Militia played “God save the King.” We
    then presented all the bards &amp; poets with medals. We then [went] into
    the drawing-room and remained there till dinner. In the drawing-room
    there were a great many other people. At 5 we went to dinner, which
    was in a temporary building which was lined in the inside with pink
    and white linen. The dinner was splendidly served &amp; the china was rich
    and beautiful. The fruit was magnificent. After dessert was over Sir
    Richard made a speech and brought out a toast in honor of Mamma &amp; me.
    We then left the room &amp; went into the drawing-room. We went upstairs
    into Lady Bulkeley’s pretty little dressing-room. Her toilet table was
    pink with white muslin over it trimmed with beautiful lace &amp; her things
    on the toilet table were gold. We then went downstairs and took coffee
    and the famous dog of Lady Williams,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Cabriolle, played tricks. At
    about 7 we left Baron Hill &amp; proceeded homewards. Poor Lady Catherine
    who was not able to go was in the evening much better. We arrived at
    home at about a ¼ past 8. I then went downstairs &amp; stayed up till near
    9. I was soon in bed and asleep....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 17th September.</i>—I awoke at about 8, &amp; got up at near
    ½ past 8. We breakfasted at 9 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>downstairs. I then played and did
    other things. At 1 we lunched. I then played on the piano, &amp; at a
    little before 3 played at billiards downstairs, with Victoire,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> &amp;
    then went out walking. When I came home I first worked &amp; then we blew
    soap-bubbles.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 14th October.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½
    past 8 we breakfasted. I then wrote my Journal and some music and at 11
    we went to chapel for the last time and the sailors likewise for the
    last time. The service was performed as usual by Mr. W. Jones. It was
    over at ¼ past 12. I then walked out with Lehzen<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and Victoire. At 1
    we lunched. At 3 we went out riding, and as we passed through the Park
    gate the old woman at the lodge came out as usual, to open the gate and
    she thanked Mamma for what she had given her. We galloped over a green
    field which we had already done several times. Rosa went an enormous
    rate; she literally <em>flew</em>. We then went on towards the Menai
    bridge but turned back under the hill. We cantered a great deal and
    Rosa went the whole time beautifully. It was a delightful ride. When
    we came home Mamma got on Rosa and I got on Thomas and cantered him.
    We came in at ½ past 4. Alas! it was our last ride at <em>dear</em> Plas
    Newydd. I then walked on the terrace for a short time. At 7 we dined
    and I stayed up till ½ past 8. I was soon in bed and asleep.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 15th October.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 5 and got up at 6. At
    7 we breakfasted with all the family; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>and a most beautiful falcon
    which Sir John Williams<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> sent me was brought in that I might see it.
    The sailors were so busy and so useful for I saw Kew and Sparks going
    to and fro. At a ¼ to 8 we got into our carriages and drove out amidst
    the shouts of the sailors of the <cite>Emerald</cite>, who were standing
    on the rigging two by two on the rope-ladders, till the last man was
    at the very top of all. I looked out of the carriage window that I
    might get a last look of the <cite>dear Emerald</cite> and her <em>excellent
    crew</em>. As we passed along the road we saw Mr. Griffith and Mr. W.
    Jones and his family....</p>

  <p>10 minutes to 4.—We have just passed through Northop. At about ½
    past 4 we went through the Park of Mr. Granville up to his castle.
    Lord Grosvenor met us there at the head of his Cavalry. And Lord
    Westminster<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> sent his own fine horses, which were put to our
    carriage. At about ½ past 5 we arrived at Eaton Hall. We were received
    at the door by Lord and Lady Westminster, Lady Grosvenor and Lady
    Wilton. The house is magnificent. You drive up to the door under a
    lofty vaulted portico with a flight of steps under it, and it takes
    you to the hall, which is beautiful. The floor is inlaid with various
    marbles, and arches spring from the sides. Then you enter a beautiful
    drawing-room; the ceiling joins in a round gilt, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>with great taste and
    richness, while the sides arch towards the top. An organ on the right
    as you enter the room and a large fireplace on the left with stained
    glass windows. Then Lady Westminster after we had been downstairs a
    little, showed us our apartments, which are indeed beautiful. I was in
    bed at ½ past 8.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 16th October.</i>—I awoke at 6 and got up at 7. I
    then dressed and took some tea. At ½ past 9 we breakfasted. The
    breakfast-room is magnificent. There are 4 fireplaces; and the windows
    are of stained glass very beautifully done. A massive lustre of gold
    with an eagle likewise in gold hangs from the ceiling in the middle
    of the room. Pillars arching to the top and gilt in parts rise from
    the sides. Several tables of oak and elm stand in the windows, and the
    breakfast was served in handsome silver tea and coffee pots; a crown of
    gold with precious stones contained the bread. Besides Lady Grosvenor
    and Lady Wilton, there were also Lady Egerton,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Mrs. Lane and Miss
    Bagot. After breakfast Lady Grosvenor brought her 4 children. We then
    went into our own rooms and I wrote my journal. At 12 Mamma went into
    the great saloon where all the ladies were and an address from the
    mayor and corporation of Chester arrived and then another from the
    gentlemen and inhabitants of Chester, presented by Lord Robert.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
    After this we looked about the room which is indeed beautiful. The
    ceiling is done in the same splendid manner and a magnificent lustre
    of gold and glass with a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>coronet of velvet and pearls hung from the
    ceiling in the room. Two windows of stained glass, very handsomely
    done, are on different sides. A superb chimney-place with beautiful
    furniture and rich carpets, complete the room. 4 beautiful pictures
    painted by different artists are likewise in the room. We then walked
    out with most of the people; I walking in front with the eldest and
    third little girl, the second not being well. We walked about the
    garden and looked at an aloe which flowers only once in 100 years. We
    came in at ½ past 1, and lunched at 2. At ½ past 2 we went out driving;
    Lady Westminster and little Elinor,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> the eldest child, were in our
    carriage; she is a delightful child. Lady Catherine and Lehzen followed
    in another carriage. We drove about the park which is beautiful. When
    we came home we walked in the kitchen gardens which are indeed very
    pretty. At ½ past 4 we came home and I worked. At 7 we dined. The
    dining-room is a fine room beautifully worked at the ceiling. Four
    large statues of Maltese stone occupy 4 corners, very beautifully
    executed; one with a helmet is Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and the
    lady<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> next by him is the heiress of Eaton; on the opposite side
    the man is Sir Robert le Grosvenor, distinguished in the battle of
    Cressy; the lady near him is a Miss Davis who by intermarrying brought
    the possessions in town, as Grosvenor Square, Belgrave Square, etc.,
    etc.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The window is stained <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>glass with the figure of Hugh Lupus on
    it. The dinner was served on plate, and the plateau was very handsome
    with gilt cups on it. The side table was covered with gold plate.
    After dinner we played at a game of letters and then I sang and Mamma
    and Lady Catherine sang and afterwards Lady Westminster played on the
    organ. I stayed up till 10....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 18th October.</i>—When we went out after luncheon we went
    in the garden first and saw a Roman altar which had been dug up near
    Chester. At 7 we dined. The breakfast-room had been arranged for this
    purpose. A temporary floor had been arranged at the top of the room,
    for our table (for all the company who had come to the bow-meeting
    dined here), and the other four were lower. After the dinner (we being
    still at table) was over some glee-singers from Chester came and sang
    the grace in Latin. Then Lord Westminster gave out some toasts; amongst
    others, “The King,” “The Queen,” Mamma and me; which were received
    extremely well. After dinner was over, I gave the children, who had
    come when dinner was over, a little remembrance. I then took leave of
    the whole family and went to bed. I stayed up till 10.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 19th October.</i>— ... ½ past 4. We have just changed horses
    at Buxton, which is a pretty place. The houses are well built and form
    a crescent. The country about here is very pretty, high rocks covered
    with trees. There are all about here little rivulets and fountains,
    rippling over stones. At ½ past 6 we arrived at Chatsworth, which is
    a beautiful house. It was quite dark. It is built in the shape of a
    square joined by an arch under which one must drive. We were met at the
    door by the Duke <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>of Devonshire<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> who conducted us up the staircase,
    which is made of wood, to our apartments which are indeed beautiful. In
    the corridor there are some beautiful statues. I dined by myself in my
    own room with Lehzen. I stayed up till ½ past 8. I was soon in bed and
    asleep.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 20th October.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 7 and got up at 8.
    At a little past 9 we breakfasted, us 5 by ourselves in a lovely room
    giving on the park and garden where one could see a cascade which
    ran all the way down. The room is small; the ceiling is painted and
    represents some mythology, with books round the room and a splendid
    carpet. At about 11 we went over the house with the company, which
    consisted of Lord and Lady Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Lord and Lady Newburgh,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
    Mr. and Lady Caroline Lascelles,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Count Karoly, Mrs. Arkwright,
    Lady <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>Clifford, Lord and Lady Wharncliffe,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Mrs. Talbot, Lord
    Morpeth,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Mr. Cooper, Mr. Henry Greville, and Miss Fanny
    Cavendish.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It would take me days, were I to describe minutely the
    whole. We went all over the house, and the carving of the frame-work
    of some looking-glasses was quite beautiful; they are carved in the
    shape of birds, the plumage being so exquisite that if it was not
    of the colour of wood one might take them for feathers. It not only
    surrounds the mirrors but the ceilings of some of the rooms. We saw
    Lady Cavendish’s little boy who is 10 months old, a beautiful child. We
    likewise saw the kitchen which is superb for its size and cleanliness;
    and the confectionary which is as pretty and neat. The Duke’s own
    apartments contain some superb statues of Canova and others; likewise
    a beautiful collection of minerals. We saw the library and dining-room
    which are all beautiful. The library’s ceiling is painted in figures;
    and the carpet is beautiful. The conservatory which leads from the
    dining-room is very pretty. We then walked out in the garden, I went
    into another conservatory which contains a rockery with water falling
    from it. There are some curious plants there, amongst others two which
    are worthy of remark; the one is called the pitcher-plant because at
    the end of each leaf hangs a little bag or pitcher which fills with
    the dew and supplies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>the plant when it wants water; the other is
    called the fly-catcher plant, because whenever a fly touches it, it
    closes. From the conservatory we went and looked at a monkey which is
    in the garden, chained. We then went to the cascade and saw some other
    fountains very curious and pretty. When we had come on the terrace
    the Duke wished us to plant two trees down under the terrace. So we
    did, I planted an oak and Mamma a Spanish chesnut. After that we went
    upon the terrace again and went up a platform which had been arranged
    with carpets, to view the cricket-match below; the Buxton band playing
    “God save the King” and the people hurraying and others under tents
    looked very pretty. From there we went to the stables where we saw some
    pretty ponies and a Russian coachman in his full dress, and the only
    Russian horse which remained reared at his command; there were 3 other
    horses, English ones, but trained like the other. At about ½ past 1
    we came home and lunched with the whole party. At ½ past 2 we went in
    a carriage and 6 with the Duke and Mrs. Cavendish, to Haddon Hall, a
    very old and singular place. The old tapestry still remaining and iron
    hooks to keep it back. We then went to the Rookery, a small cottage
    belonging to the Duke on the banks of the river Wye, very pretty and
    cool. From there we walked to the Marble Mills and saw how they sawed
    and polished the marble. There was a little cottage where they sold
    Derbyshire spar in different little shapes and forms, and some pieces
    of marble too. We then drove home after having bought a good many
    things. We came in at 5. At 7 we dined and after dinner at about ½
    past 9 we looked at the cascade illuminated, which looked very pretty,
    and the fountains, blue <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>lights, red lights, rockets, etc. At about
    10 the charade began in 3 syllables and 4 scenes. The first act was
    a scene out of <cite>Bluebeard</cite>; Lady Caroline Lascelles and Miss F.
    Cavendish acting the ladies, and Count Karoly as Bluebeard, with Lord
    Newburgh and Mr. Lascelles as their friends. The next act was a scene
    of carrying offerings to Father Nile; Mrs. Talbot, Lady Cavendish,
    Lady Clifford, Miss Cavendish, and the two Miss Smiths as the vestals;
    and Lord Morpeth, Lord Newburgh, Count Karoly, Mr. Greville, Sir A.
    Clifford,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr Cooper, and Mr. Lascelles as the men. Mr. Beaumont
    was Father Nile. The third act was a scene of <cite>Tom Thumb</cite>; Lord
    Morpeth as Tom Thumb, and Lord Newburgh as the nurse. The fourth act
    was a scene out of <cite>Kenilworth</cite> (which was the word); Mrs. Talbot
    as Queen Elizabeth, Lady Cavendish as Amy, Lady Caroline and Miss
    Cavendish (who danced the menuet with Count Karoly) as her attendants;
    little Georgina Lascelles<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> as page to bear the Queen’s train,
    Lord Morpeth as Lord Leicester, Lord Newburgh as an attendant, Count
    Karoly as Lord Shrewsbury, Mr. Cooper as Sir Walter Raleigh, and Lord
    Waterpark<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and Mr. Greville as two more men of the Queen’s, not to
    omit Lady Clifford as the Queen’s lady, and Sir Augustus as a gentleman
    of the Queen. They were all in regular costumes. When it was over,
    which was at ¼ to 12, I went to bed....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 24th October.</i>— ... At 1 we arrived at Alton Towers,
    the seat of Lord Shrewsbury.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>This is an extraordinary house. On
    arriving one goes into a sort of gallery filled with armour, guns,
    swords, pistols, models, flags, etc., etc., then into a gallery filled
    with beautiful pictures and then into a conservatory with birds. We
    lunched there and the luncheon was served on splendid gold plate. We
    then walked in the gardens. At ½ past 2 we left it....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 31st October.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7.
    At ½ past 9 we breakfasted in the drawing-room, for the gentlemen who
    were going to hunt breakfasted in the other room, all the ladies and
    Sir John breakfasting with us. After breakfast at about ½ past 10 we
    went into the room where they were, and they gave us a toast with many
    cheers. After that we walked out to see the hunt. We saw them set off.
    It was an immense field of horsemen, who in their red jackets and black
    hats looked lively and gave an animating appearance to the whole. They
    had a large pack of hounds and three huntsmen or Whippers-in. They drew
    a covert near here in hopes of finding a fox, but as they did not they
    returned and we got into the carriage with Lady Selina<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and Lehzen
    while all the huntsmen and the hounds followed. When we came to a
    field, they drew another covert and succeeded; we saw the fox dash past
    and all the people and hounds after him, the hounds in full cry. The
    hounds killed him in a wood quite close by. The huntsman then brought
    him out and cutting off the brush Sir Edward Smith (to whom the hounds
    belong) brought it to me. Then the huntsmen cut off for themselves
    the ears and 4 paws, and lastly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>they threw it to the dogs, who tore
    it from side to side till there was nothing left. We then went home.
    At 1 we lunched, and at 2, I, Lady Selina, Lady Louisa<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and dear
    Lehzen went out walking, towards a farm of Lord Liverpool’s, and when
    we had passed the farm and were going to return by the village, we
    heard the blast of a horn and we looked and saw the hounds and hunters
    going full gallop along a field which was below the field in which we
    were walking. They came and crossed the field in which we were and we
    saw all the riders leap over a ditch. We went back the same way that
    we might see them. When we came near home we saw them go home by the
    house. At ½ past 3 we came home. At ½ past 6 we dined, and I received
    my brush which had been fixed on a stick by the huntsman; it is a
    beautiful one. Amongst the people who were here, those who remain are
    Mr., Mrs., and Miss Corbett, Mr., Mrs., and Miss Child. After dinner
    the young ladies played some pretty things from the <cite>Pirata</cite> and
    from <cite>Fra Diavolo</cite>. I stayed up till near 10....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 7th November.</i>— ... ¼ to 4. We have just changed
    horses at Woodstock, and another detachment of Yeomanry commanded
    by Lord Churchill<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> ride with us now. We passed through Oxford on
    our way. At about a little past 5 we arrived at Wytham Abbey, the
    seat of Lord Abingdon.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We were received at the door by Lord and
    Lady Abingdon, Lady Charlotte Bertie and Lady <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>Emily Bathurst, their
    daughters. The house is very comfortable; in the drawing-room there is
    a lovely picture by Angelica Kauffman, Penelope. After staying a few
    minutes downstairs we went upstairs to our rooms which are very pretty
    and comfortable. At a little past 7 we dined with several other people.
    I stayed up till a little past 9.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 8th November.</i>—I awoke at a little to 8 and got up
    at 8. At a little past 9 we breakfasted with the whole party. At 10
    o’clock we set out for Oxford in a close carriage and 4 with Lord
    Abingdon and Lady Charlotte Bertie; the other ladies going in carriages
    before us. We got out first at the Divinity College, and walked from
    thence to the theatre, which was built by Sir Christopher Wren.
    The ceiling is painted with allegorical figures. The galleries are
    ornamented with carving enriched with gold. It was filled to excess. We
    were most <span class="smcap">warmly</span> and <span class="smcap">enthusiastically</span> received. They
    hurrayed and applauded us immensely for there were all the students
    there; all in their gowns and caps. Mamma received an address which
    was presented by the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Rowly, and Mamma answered it
    as usual. Then Sir John<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was made a Doctor of Civil Law. After that
    was over, we returned through Divinity College and proceeded in our
    carriages to the Council Chamber where Mamma received an address there,
    from the corporation of Oxford, and Sir John the freedom of the City
    of Oxford. We then went to Christ Church, which is very fine, viewed
    the hall and chapel and library. Dr. Gaisford<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> is the Dean of Christ
    Church and is at the head of that college. From there we went to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>the
    Bodleian library which is immense. Amongst other curiosities there is
    Queen Elizabeth’s Latin exercise book when she was of my age (13). We
    went through Mr. Sneed’s house to our carriages. From there to All
    Souls’ College where Mr. Sneed is the warden. It is not a college for
    education, but after they have taken their degree. We saw the library
    and chapel which is very beautiful. We then went to University College
    of which the Vice-chancellor is the head. We lunched there and saw
    the chapel which is very fine. From there we went to New College of
    which Dr. Shuttleworth<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> is the head. We saw the chapel and hall.
    From there to the Clarendon printing-press which is very amusing but
    would take up too much space and time to describe. We then went home.
    We arrived at home at ½ past 3. At 7 we dined with some other people
    who were Lord Cantelupe,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Lord Folkestone,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>

    stayed up till 10.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 9th November.</i>— ... At about ½ past 5 we arrived at
    Kensington Palace. We resumed our old rooms. At 7 we dined with Jane
    and Victoire Conroy, Lord Liverpool and Sir John. My aunt Sophia<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
    came after dinner. I stayed up till a ¼ to 9.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 24th December.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we
    breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and I gave him Mamma’s
    and my Christmas box. He stayed till ½ past 11. In the course of the
    morning I gave Mrs. Brock a Christmas box and all our people. At ½ past
    1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Westall<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> till ½ past 3. At 4 came
    Mr. Sale<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> till 5. At a ¼ to 7 we dined with the whole Conroy family
    and Mr. Hore downstairs, as our Christmas tables were arranged in our
    dining-room. After dinner we went upstairs. I then saw Flora, the dog
    which Sir John was going to give Mamma. Aunt Sophia came also. We then
    went into the drawing-room near the dining-room. After Mamma had rung
    a bell three times we went in. There were two large round tables on
    which were placed two trees hung with lights and sugar ornaments. All
    the presents being placed round the tree. I had one table for myself
    and the Conroy family had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>the other together. Lehzen had likewise a
    little table. Mamma gave me a little lovely pink bag which she had
    worked with a little sachet likewise done by her; a beautiful little
    opal brooch and earrings, books, some lovely prints, a pink satin dress
    and a cloak lined with fur. Aunt Sophia gave me a dress which she
    worked herself, and Aunt Mary<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> a pair of amethyst earrings. Lehzen
    a lovely music-book. Victoire a <em>very</em> pretty white bag worked by
    herself, and Sir John a silver brush. I gave Lehzen some little things
    and Mamma gave her a writing table. We then went to my room where I had
    arranged Mamma’s table. I gave Mamma a white bag which I had worked,
    a collar and a steel chain for Flora, and an Annual; Aunt Sophia a
    pair of turquoise earrings; Lehzen a little white and gold pincushion
    and a pin with two little gold hearts hanging to it; Sir John, Flora,
    a book-holder and an Annual. Mamma then took me up into my bedroom
    with all the ladies. There was my new toilet table with a white muslin
    cover over pink, and all my silver things standing on it with a fine
    new looking-glass. I stayed up till ½ past 9. The dog went away again
    to the doctor for her leg. I saw good Louis<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> for an instant and she
    gave me a lovely little wooden box with bottles.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Princess was fourteen years old she obtained her first
      sight of Osborne, that future home in the Isle of Wight where
      she was destined to spend so many happy years, and which was
      associated with the closing scenes of her life. Osborne Lodge was
      the residence of Sir John Conroy. It occupied the site of Osborne
      Cottage, now the residence of the Queen’s youngest daughter,
      Princess Henry of Battenberg. In spite of the changes made in the
      appearance of Osborne by the erection of Osborne House and the
      laying-out of the grounds round it, that portion of the estate
      where Osborne Cottage stands, and Whippingham Church, with its
      manifold associations, have much the same aspect as they had when
      first explored by Princess Victoria in 1833.</p>

    <p>On her birthday, King William gave a children’s party at St.
      James’s in his niece’s honour, and the ball was opened by the
      little Princess and her cousin Prince George of Cambridge, then a
      boy of fourteen, who was afterwards to be the Commander-in-Chief of
      her armies. The Princess speaks of the ball-room. It is difficult
      to be sure which room is meant by this. The eastern end of St.
      James’s Palace had been destroyed by fire in 1809, and had only
      recently been rebuilt. The Palace was occupied by William IV. and
      Queen Adelaide, the Queen’s rooms being in that portion which is
      now called Clarence House, and the King’s apartments occupying
      the western end of what is now St. James’s Palace proper. It was
      probably the room hung with yellow silk, next but one to the
      Throne-room, so familiar to those who attend the King’s Levées,
      that the little Princess opened her first ball.</p>

    <p>This was not her first introduction into Society. Three years
      before she had been seen at Court, and in 1831 she had attended a
      Drawing-room.</p>

    <p>The Princess now acquired a habit (which she practised for many
      years) of making sketches from memory of the artists and scenes
      that struck her imagination during her visits to the theatre.
      There are many volumes at Windsor Castle full of the Princess’s
      recollections of the theatre, drawn in pencil or in water-colour.
      Although the technique may be faulty, these sketches are full
      of movement and quaintly descriptive. They indicate an absorbed
      attention on her part, and a vivid memory. They suggest a power
      of concentration upon the thing she was about, which became in
      after-life a marked characteristic. From her journals and her
      sketches as a child of fourteen, an inference might be drawn that
      little escaped the acute observation of the little Princess. There
      are many who remember how in later life very little escaped the
      observation of the Queen.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 15th January.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 10
    minutes to 9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past
    11. Just before we went out, Mamma’s little dog, a beautiful spaniel
    of King Charles’s breed, called Dash, and which Sir John gave her
    yesterday, came and will now remain here. At a ¼ past 12 Lehzen and I
    went out walking in the park. We met Mrs. Talbot. When we came home I
    fed dear Rosy who was <em>so</em> greedy. At ½ past 1 we lunched. At 3
    came Mr. Steward<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> till 4. At 4 came Mons. Grandineau<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> till 5.
    Little Dash is <em>perfection</em>, he is already much attached to Mamma
    and lies always at her feet. At 7 we dined. Aunt Sophia came at 8. Sir
    John dined here. I stayed up till ½ past 8....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 31st January.</i>—At 1 we lunched. At 2 I sat to Mr.
    Hayter<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> till 10 minutes to 4. At 5 we dined. Sir John dined here.
    At ½ past 6 we went with Lady Conroy, Jane and Victoire to the play to
    Drury Lane. It was the opera of <cite>The Barber of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>Seville</cite>.
    It is so well known that I need not describe it. The principal
    characters were Count Almaviva, Mr. Wood, who looked, sang, and acted
    <em>extremely</em> well; Rosina, Mrs. Wood; Figaro, Mr. Philipps, who
    sung very well; Dr. Bartolo, Mr. Seguin, who acted very well. It was in
    3 acts and I was very <em>much amused</em>. The after piece called <cite>The
    Nervous Man</cite> is only amusing in parts, for Mr. Farren<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Mr.
    Power, two excellent comic actors. We did not see the end of it. We
    came home at 12....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 9th February.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7.
    At ½ past 8 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till 11. At ½
    past 12 we lunched. At I we paid a visit to my aunt the Duchess of
    Gloucester.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> When we came home I fed dear little Rosa, and little
    Isabell. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Westall<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> till ½ past 3. At a ¼ past
    5 we dined. Sir John dined here. At ½ past 6 we went to the play
    with Lady Conroy, Victoire and Lehzen as usual. It was the ballet of
    <cite>Kenilworth</cite>. The subject is taken from the novel by Sir Walter
    Scott, which being so well known I shall not describe. The principal
    characters were, Lord Leicester, Mons. Theodore Guerinot, who danced
    beautifully; Amy Robsart, Mdlle. Pauline Leroux, who danced and acted
    <em>beautifully</em> and looked <em>quite</em> lovely; Jenny, Madame Proche
    Giubilei, who acted very well and looked very pretty; Queen Elizabeth,
    Mrs. Vining; Varney, Mr. W. H. Payne; Earl of Sussex, Signor Rossi;
    Lord Shrewsbury,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> Mr. Bertram. Besides these, Mdlle. Adele and Mdlle.
    Chavigny danced a pas de trois with Mons. Theodore Guerinot. They
    danced very well. At 20 minutes past 9 we came home. I then took tea....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 5th April.</i>—To-day is Good Friday. At 10 we went to
    prayers. Jane and Victoire also. The service was performed by the
    Dean, who gave us likewise a very good sermon. It was taken from the
    8th chapter of the Acts of the Apostles, 30th verse. At a ¼ past 12
    we went out walking. When we came home I fed sweet Rosy. At ½ past I
    we lunched. At 3 came Victoire till 5. At 7 we dined. At 8 came Aunt
    Sophia. I stayed up till ½ past 8....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 13th April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ to 9
    we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past 11. The Duchess
    of Northumberland<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> was present. At 12 we went out riding in the
    park with Victoire, Lehzen and Sir John. It was a <em>delightful</em>
    ride. We cantered a good deal. <span class="smcap">Sweet little Rosy</span> went
    <span class="smcap">beautifully</span>!! We came home at a ¼ past 1. At ½ past 1 we
    lunched. Neither of my masters came. At 6 we dined. The Duchess of
    Northumberland, Lady Charlotte St. Maur,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and Sir John dined here.
    At 20 minutes to 7 we went out with them to the Opera. We were very
    much <em>disappointed</em> for Taglioni did not make her début, nor
    Rubini. We had only one scene of <cite>Il Barbière di Siviglia</cite>, in
    which Signor Tambourini, who is a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span><em>beautiful</em> singer and actor,
    appeared, and Donizelli. After waiting for half an hour Laporte
    (the manager) was called out, and he said that Mlle. Taglioni was
    very unwell in bed, and Mad. Méric was likewise ill, so that <cite>Il
    Pirato</cite> could not be performed, but that Rubini would be there
    directly. After one act of <cite>Fidelio</cite>, which was <em>shockingly</em>
    performed, Rubini came on and sang a song out of <cite>Anna Boulena</cite>
    <em>quite beautifully</em>. After that there was the ballet of <cite>La
    Somnambula</cite>. The principal characters were Mdlle. Pauline Leroux,
    who looked <span class="smcap">quite lovely</span> and acted prettily; Mdlle. Adele;
    Madame Proche Giubelei who looked <em>very pretty</em>; Messrs. Albert
    and Coulon. We only saw part of it. We came home at ½ past 11....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 23rd April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7.
    At 9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past 11. The
    Duchess of Northumberland was present. At a ¼ past 12 we went out
    riding with Lady Conroy, Victoire, Lehzen, and Sir John. We rode a
    little way in the park, but the fog was so thick that we turned round
    and rode down by Gloucester Road, and turned up by Phillimore Place,
    where it was very fine and not at all foggy. <em>Dear</em> Rosa went
    <em>beautifully</em>. We came home at ½ past 1. At ½ past 1 we lunched.
    At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. At 4 came Mons. Grandineau till 5. At a ¼
    to 7 we dined. Sir John dined here, and I dressed <span class="smcap">dear sweet little
    Dash</span> for the second time after dinner in a scarlet jacket and blue
    trousers. At 20 minutes past 8 Mamma went with Jane and Sir John to the
    Opera. I stayed up till ½ past 8.</p>

    lunched. At 3 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>came Mons. Grandineau till 4. Madame Bourdin<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> did not
    come. At ½ past 6 Lehzen and I dined. At 7 I and Lehzen went into the
    large saloon, for Mamma gave a dinner to the King. There dined here,
    the King (the Queen being too unwell to come), the Duke of Cumberland,
    the Duke of Gloucester, the Archbishop of Canterbury,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the Lord

    Sir Frederick Wetherall,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and Sir John. At about 8 I went to my room
    with Lehzen. At 20 minutes past 9 I went into the saloon with her to
    meet the company. The Grenadier Guards’ band played after dinner. I saw
    all the company go. I stayed up till 11....</p>

    to have my profile taken for a medal, till 10 minutes to 5. At 6 we
    dined. Sir John dined here. At a ¼ past 7 we went with Lady Conroy and
    Lehzen, as usual, to the Opera. It was the opera of <cite>Cenerentola</cite>
    by Rossini. The principal characters were the Prince, by Signor
    Donizelli; the Prince’s servant, Signor Tambourini who sung <span class="smcap">quite
    beautifully</span>; the father of Cenerentola, Signor Zuchelli, who
    acted <em>uncommonly well</em>; Cenerentola, Madame Cinti Damoreau;
    she sang <span class="smcap">quite beautifully</span>, so round, so softly, and so
    correctly. It was her first appearance this season and she was called
    out. The sisters were two <span class="smcap">frightful</span> creatures. The ballet
    which followed was <cite>Flore et Zephir</cite>. Mdlle. Taglioni<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> made

    <em>beautifully</em>, so lightly and <em>gracefully</em>, and each step so
    finished! She took the part of Flore, and was very prettily dressed in
    a plain gauze dress, trimmed with flowers across her skirt; a wreath of
    flowers round her head, and her hair quite flat. Pearls round her neck
    and arms. She looked <em>lovely</em>, for she is all-ways smiling. We
    went away soon. We came home at 12....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 3rd May.</i>—At 12 we went with the Duchess of
    Northumberland, Lady Charlotte St. Maur, Lady Catherine Jenkinson,
    Lady Cust, Lady Conroy, Lehzen, Sir George Anson, and Sir John, to the
    Exhibition at Somerset House. We were met there by Sir Martin Shee<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
    (the President), Mr. Westall, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>Mr. Howard<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> (the Treasurer), Mr.

    There were several very fine pictures by Sir Martin Shee. Seven by Mr.
    Westall. They were 4 landscapes, a drawing of Christ in the arms of
    Simeon in the temple; a sleeping Cupid, and the death of James 2nd.
    All very fine. There were 5 of G. Hayter’s but I only saw 3, which
    were my picture,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Lady Lichfield, and Mad. de Delmar’s. There were
    3 of Wilkie’s, a portrait of the King, a very beautiful portrait of

  <p><i>Wednesday, 8th May.</i>—At ½ past 2 came Mons. Grandineau till ½
    past 3. At a ¼ past 4 we walked through the gardens, and then drove in
    the barouche in the park. We came home at 5. At ½ past 6 Lehzen and I
    dined. At a little past 7 Lehzen and I went into the saloon, for Mamma
    gave a dinner. There dined here, H.R.H. the Duke of Orleans,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> who

    At about 8 I went with Lehzen away. The band of the Coldstream Guards
    played at dinner as well as after dinner, as it had the preceding
    night. At 20 minutes after 9 Lehzen and I went into the saloon. We met
    Aunt Sophia there....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 11th May.</i>—At a ¼ to 7 we dined. Sir John dined here.
    At a little after 8 we went to the Opera with Victoire, Lehzen, and
    Charles. We came in at the end of the first act of <cite>Medea</cite>. Madame
    Pasta sang, and acted beautifully, as did also Rubini and Donizelli.
    The ballet was excessively pretty. It is called <cite>Nathalie</cite>. The
    principal dancers were Mdlle. Taglioni, who danced and acted <span class="smcap">quite
    beautifully</span>!! She looked <em>very</em> pretty. Her dress was very
    pretty. It was a sort of Swiss dress; she first appeared in a petticoat
    of brown and yellow, with a blue and white apron, a body of black
    velvet ornamented with silver, pointed upwards and downwards, over a
    light tucker drawn to her neck, with a black ribbon round it, a pair
    of small white sleeves, a little Swiss straw hat, with long plaits of
    her hair hanging down, completed her first dress. Her second dress was
    a petticoat of scarlet and yellow silk, with a white apron, the same
    body and sleeves, with a wreath of flowers on her head. Mdlles. Thérèse
    and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>Fanny Elsler; they are good dancers, but have neither grace nor
    lightness. Messrs. Albert, Coulon, and Daumont. In the middle of the
    ballet the Duke of Orleans came into our box for a little while. We saw
    most of the ballet. I was <em>very much</em> amused....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 24th May.</i>—To-day is my birthday. I am to-day fourteen
    years old! How <em>very old</em>!! I awoke at ½ <em>past</em> 5 and got
    up at ½ past 7. I received from Mamma a lovely hyacinth brooch and a
    china pen tray. From Uncle Leopold a very kind letter, also one from
    Aunt Louisa and sister Feodora. I gave Mamma a little ring. From Lehzen
    I got a pretty little china figure, and a lovely little china basket.
    I gave her a golden chain and Mamma gave her a pair of earrings to
    match. From my maids, Frances and Caroline, I also got little trifles
    of their own work. At ½ past 8 we breakfasted. After breakfast we went
    into the room where my table was arranged. Mamma gave me a lovely bag
    of her own work, a beautiful bracelet, two lovely féronières, one
    of pink topaz, the other turquoises; two dresses, some prints, some
    books, some handkerchiefs, and an apron. From Lehzen, a beautiful

    not ready. At about ½ past 10 came Sir John and his three sons. From
    Sir John I received <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>a very pretty picture of Dash, very like, the
    size of life. From Jane, Victoire, Edward, Stephen, and Henry, a very
    pretty enamel watch-chain. From Lady Conroy a sandalwood pincushion
    and needle-case. From Victoire alone, a pair of enamel earrings. The
    Duchess of Gordon sent me a lovely little crown of precious stones,
    which plays “God save the King,” and a china basket. At 12 came the
    Duchess of Northumberland (who gave me an ivory basket filled with
    the work of her nieces), Lady Charlotte St. Maur a beautiful album
    with a painting on it; Lady Catherine Jenkinson a pretty night-lamp.

    Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir George Anson, Sir John, and the
    Dean came also. Lady Conroy brought Bijou (her little dog) with her,
    and she gave me a little sweet smelling box. They stayed till ½ past
    12. Victoire remained with us. I gave her a portrait of Isabel, her
    horse. At 1 we lunched. Victoire stayed till ½ past 2. At ½ past 2

    of a lily of the valley. Lady Mayo,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> who was in waiting on the
    Queen, gave me a glass bottle. They stayed till ½ past 3 and then went
    away. I had seen in the course of the day, Sarah, my former maid, and
    Mrs. Brock. Ladies Emma and Georgiana Herbert<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> sent me a sachet
    for handkerchiefs worked by themselves. Ladies Sarah and Clementina
    Villiers<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> sent me some flowers as combs and a brooch. Mr. Collen
    sent me a little painting for my album. At a ¼ to 6 we dined. At ½ past
    7 we went with Charles, the Duchess of Northumberland, Lady Catherine
    Jenkinson, Lehzen, Sir George Anson, and Sir John, to a Juvenile Ball
    that was given in honour of my birthday at St. James’s by the King and
    Queen. We went into the Closet. Soon after, the doors were opened, and
    the King leading me went into the ball-room. Madame Bourdin was there
    as dancing-mistress. Victoire was also there, as well as <em>many</em>
    other children whom I knew. Dancing began soon after. I danced first
    with my cousin George Cambridge, then with Prince George Lieven,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
    then with Lord Brook,<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>Lord
    March,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> then with Lord

    Emlyn.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> We then went to supper. It was ½ past 11; the King leading
    me again. I sat between the King and Queen. We left supper soon. My
    health was drunk. I then danced one more quadrille with Lord Paget. I
    danced in all <em>8</em> quadrilles. We came home at ½ past 12. I was
    <span class="smcap">very</span> much amused....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 16th June.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At a ¼
    to 9 we breakfasted. At 10 we went to prayers. At 10 came Victoire and
    went to prayers with us. The service was performed by Mr. Pittman, as
    the poor Dean had the misfortune to lose his little girl Charlotte, of
    the scarlet fever, which I was very sorry for. Mr. Pittman gave us a
    beautiful sermon. It was taken from the 11th chapter of the Gospel of
    St. Luke, 1st verse. At 1 we lunched. Victoire stayed till ½ past 2. At
    3 arrived my two cousins, Princes Alexander and Ernst Würtemberg, sons
    of Mamma’s sister, my Aunt Antoinette.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> They are both <em>extremely
    tall</em>. Alexander is <em>very handsome</em> and Ernst has a <em>very
    kind expression</em>. They are both <span class="smcap">extremely</span> <em>amiable</em>.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>At 4 we went out driving in the open carriage. We paid a visit to Aunt
    Gloucester, and then drove home through the park. We came home at a ¼
    to 6. At a ¼ past 7 we dined. Besides Alexander, Ernst and Charles,
    Prince Reuss<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> and Sir John dined here....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 27th June.</i>—At ½ past 9 we went to the Exhibition of
    the water-colours, with Alexander and Lehzen in our carriage, and
    Sir John in another. We met the Duchess of Northumberland there.
    It is a <span class="smcap">very fine</span> exhibition. From there we went to the
    British Gallery, where the works of Sir Joshua Reynolds, West, and
    Sir Thomas Lawrence are exhibiting. We came home at ½ past 11. At
    1 we lunched. At 2 came Lady Stafford with her two little girls,
    Elizabeth<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and Evelyn,<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
    and Lady Caroline<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> with her
    little Georgiana. All beautiful children. At ½ past 4 we drove out
    in the park, and walked home through the gardens. We came home at ½
    past 5. At 7 we all dined. Sir John dined here. At a little after
    9 we went, with Alexander and Lehzen in our carriage, and Ernst,
    Charles and Sir John in another carriage following, to the Opera. We
    came in at the beginning of the 2nd act of <cite>Norma</cite>, in which
    Madame Pasta sung <span class="smcap">beautifully</span>. After that Signor Paganini
    played by himself some variations, most <span class="smcap">wonderfully</span>; he is
    himself a <em>curiosity</em>. After that was given the last act of
    <cite>Otello</cite>; Desdemona, Madame Malibran,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> who sang and acted
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span><span class="smcap">beautifully</span>. After that was performed <cite>La Sylphide</cite>;
    Taglioni danced <span class="smcap">beautifully</span> and looked <span class="smcap">lovely</span>. Fanny
    Elsler danced also <em>very well</em>. We saw the whole of the 1st act
    and half of the second. It was Laporte’s benefit. I was <span class="smcap">very much
    amused</span>. We came home at ½ past 1. I was soon in bed and asleep....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 1st July.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 4 and got up at a ¼
    past 5. At a ¼ past 6 we all breakfasted. At 7 o’clock we left
    Kensington Palace, Sir John going in a post-chaise before us, then
    our post-chaise, then Lehzen’s landau, then my Cousins’ carriage,
    then Charles’s, then Lady Conroy’s, and then our maids’. It is a
    lovely morning. 5 minutes past 8—we have just changed horses at Esher.
    Lynedoch Gardiner<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> brought us a basket full of beautiful flowers.
    10 o’clock; we have just changed horses at Guildford. <span class="smcap">Poor dear
    little</span> Dashy could not go with us as he was not quite well, so
    he is gone with Mason with the horses. 4 minutes past 1; we have just
    left Liphook where we took our luncheon. 5 minutes to 2, we have just
    changed horses at Petersfield. 5 minutes to 3, we have just changed
    horses at Horndean. At 4 we arrived at Portsmouth. The streets were
    lined with soldiers, and Sir Colin Campbell<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> rode by the carriage.
    Sir Thomas Williams,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the Admiral, took us in his barge, on board
    the <cite>dear Emerald</cite>. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>Admiral presented some of the officers
    to us. We stayed about ½ an hour waiting for the baggage to be put on
    board the steamer, which was to tow us. We then set off and arrived
    at Cowes at about 7. We were most civilly received. Cowes Castle, the
    yacht-club, yachts, &amp;c., &amp;c., saluting us. We saw Lord Durham<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> who
    is staying at Cowes. We drove up in a fly to Norris Castle, where we
    lodged two years ago, and where we are again living. My cousins and my
    brother were <em>delighted</em> with it. At about ½ past 7 we all dined.
    Lady Conroy and her family went to their cottage after dinner....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 8th July.</i>—At about 10 we went on board the
    <cite>Emerald</cite> with Alexander, Ernst, Lady Charlotte, Lady Conroy,
    Jane, Victoire, Sir John and Henry. We were towed up to Southampton
    by the <cite>Medina</cite> steam-packet. It rained several times very hard,
    and we were obliged to go down into the cabin very often. When we
    arrived at Southampton, Mamma received an address on board from the
    Corporation. We then got into the barge and rowed up to the new pier.
    The crowd was tremendous. We went into a tent erected on the pier, and
    I was very much frightened for fear my cousins and the rest of our
    party should get knocked about; however they at last got in. We then
    got into our barge and went on board the <cite>Emerald</cite> where we took
    our luncheon. We <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>stayed a little while to see the regatta, which was
    going on, and then sailed home. It was a very wet afternoon. We came
    home at ½ past 5. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir John,
    and Henry dined here....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 12th July.</i>—I awoke at 6 and got up at ½ past 6. At 7
    we breakfasted. It was a <em>sad</em> breakfast, for us indeed, as my
    dear cousins were going so soon. At about a ¼ to 8 we walked down
    our pier with them and there took leave of them, which made us both
    <span class="smcap">very unhappy</span>. We saw them get into the barge, and watched them
    sailing away for some time on the beach. They were so amiable and so
    pleasant to have in the house; they were <em>always satisfied, always
    good humoured</em>; Alexander took such care of me in getting out of
    the boat, and rode next to me; so did Ernst. They talked about <em>such
    interesting things</em>, about their Turkish Campaign, about Russia,
    &amp;c., &amp;c. We shall miss them at <em>breakfast</em>, at <em>luncheon</em>,
    at <em>dinner</em>, <em>riding</em>, <em>sailing</em>, <em>driving</em>,
    <em>walking</em>, in <em>fact everywhere</em>.</p>

  <p>About two hours after my cousins had gone, Mamma received the
    distressing news that my cousins’ father, the Duke Alexander of
    Würtemberg,<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> who had been ill for some time, was dead. I was
    extremely sorry for them. Mamma immediately dispatched an estafette
    after them to Dover with the news. At 1 we lunched. It was a dull
    luncheon. At 4 we went out riding with Lady Charlotte, Lady Conroy,
    Jane, Victoire, Sir John and Henry. Victoire rode Alice, and Lehzen
    Isabel. The ride would have appeared to me much pleasanter had
    Alexander and Ernst been there. We came home at 6. We heard from a
    servant of ours, who had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>crossed over with them to Portsmouth, that
    they had had a very quick and good passage and that they had not been
    at all sick. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Sir John,
    Edward, and Henry dined here. Here again they were missing....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 18th July.</i>—At a ¼ to 10 we went on board the
    <cite>Emerald</cite> with Lady Charlotte, Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire,
    Lehzen, and Sir John, and were towed by the <cite>Messenger</cite>
    steam-packet up to Portsmouth. We then got into the Admiral’s barge,
    and landed in the docks. We then saw from an elevation, the launch of
    the <cite>Racer</cite>, a sloop of war. We then re-entered the Admiral’s
    barge and went to the <cite>Victory</cite>, his flag-ship. We there received
    the salute on board. We saw the spot where Nelson fell, and which
    is covered up with a brazen plate and his motto is inscribed on it,
    “Every Englishman is expected to do his duty.” We went down as low
    as the tanks, and there tasted the water which had been in there
    for two years, and which was excellent. We also saw the place where
    Nelson died. The whole ship is remarkable for its neatness and order.
    We tasted some of the men’s beef and potatoes, which were excellent,
    and likewise some grog. The company consisted of Lady Williams, the
    Admiral’s lady, Sir Graham and Lady Moore,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> Mr. and Mrs. Ricardo,
    Sir Frederick and Lady Maitland,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> etc., etc. We then partook
    of a luncheon at the Admiral’s House and then returned on board
    the <cite>Emerald</cite>. We got home by 5. We both wished so much that
    <em>dear</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>Alexander and <em>dear</em> Ernest had been there, I think
    it would have amused them....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 2nd August.</i>—I awoke at about a ¼ to 6 and got up at ½
    past 7. At ½ past 8 we all breakfasted. We then saw several ladies
    and gentlemen. At about ½ past 9 we went on board the <cite>dear little
    Emerald</cite>. We were to be towed up to Plymouth. Mamma and Lehzen
    were very sick, and I was sick for about ½ an hour. At 1 I had a hot
    mutton chop on deck. We passed Dartmouth. At about 4 we approached
    Plymouth Harbour. It is a magnificent place and the breakwater is
    wonderful indeed. You pass Mount Edgecumbe, the seat of Lord Mount
    Edgecumbe.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It is beautifully situated. The Admiral, Sir William
    Hargood,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Captain Falkland his flag-captain, and Mr. Yorke<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>
    came on board. Captain Brown, who is on board the <cite>Caledonia</cite>, and
    Captain Macay, on board the <cite>Revenge</cite>, also came on board. As we
    entered the harbour, our dear little <cite>Emerald</cite> ran foul of a hulk,
    her mast broke and we were in the <em>greatest danger</em>. Thank God!
    the mast did not fall and no one was hurt. But I was <em>dreadfully</em>
    frightened for <em>Mamma</em> and for <em>all</em>. The poor dear
    <cite>Emerald</cite> is very much hurt I fear. Saunders was not at all in
    fault; he saved us by pulling the rope which fixed us to the steamer.
    We arrived at Plymouth at 5. It is a beautiful town and we were very
    well received. <em>Sweet Dash</em> was under Saunders’s arm the whole
    time, but he never let him drop in all the danger. At 7 we dined. The
    hotel is very fine indeed. After dinner Sir John saw Saunders, who said
    that the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>mast of the <cite>Emerald</cite> was broken in two places, and that
    we had had the <em>narrowest escape possible</em>; but that she would be
    repaired and ready for us to go back in her on Tuesday.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 3rd August.</i>—At 10 came Sir John Cameron,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the
    Governor, and his officers. At ½ past 10 came Sir William Hargood and
    his officers and captains. Soon after came Lord Hill, who is over
    here to inspect the troops, and Sir John Macdonald,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Sir Richard
    Jackson, and Captain Hill. At ½ past 11 Mamma received an address from
    the Mayor and Corporation of Plymouth, downstairs in a large room full
    of people. At 12 we went with all our own party to a review of the
    89th, the 22nd, and the 84th regiments. Mamma made a speech, and I then
    gave the colours to the 89th regiment. The names of the two Ensigns
    to whom I gave the colours are Miles and Egerton. We then saw them
    march by in line. We then went to the Admiral’s house where we had our
    luncheon, and then proceeded to the docks. We went in the Admiral’s
    barge on board the Admiral’s flag-ship, the <cite>St. Joseph</cite>, taken
    by Lord Nelson from the Spanish, in the battle of St. Vincent. We
    received a salute on board. She is a magnificent vessel of 120 guns. We
    saw her lower decks and cabins, which are extremely light, airy, roomy
    and clean. We then returned in the Admiral’s barge, rowed round the
    <cite>Caledonia</cite> 120 guns, and the <cite>Revenge</cite> 76 guns. We landed at
    the Dockyard and went home. At 7 we dined....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 16th September.</i>—At 10 we went on board the
    <cite>Emerald</cite> with Lady Catherine, Lady Conroy, Jane, Lehzen,
    Victoire, and Sir John, and sailed to Portsmouth, where we were going
    to pay a visit to their Majesties the Queen of Portugal<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and the
    Duchess of Braganza (her step-mother). We got there at ½ past 11. We
    entered the Admiral’s barge with Lady Catherine, Lady Conroy, Lehzen,
    and Sir John, and were rowed ashore. We landed at the stairs in the
    dockyard. Mamma and I got into a close carriage, and our ladies
    followed in an open carriage. The whole way from the dock-yard to the
    Admiral’s house, where their Majesties reside, was lined with troops
    and various bands were placed at different distances. We were received
    at the door by the gentlemen and ladies of the court. Inside the hall
    we were met by the Queen and the Duchess. The Queen led Mamma, and the
    Duchess followed leading me into the room. The Queen was in England 4
    years ago; she is only a month older than I am and is very kind to me.
    She was then already very tall for her age, but had a very beautiful
    figure; she is grown very tall but also very stout. She has a beautiful
    complexion, and is very sweet and friendly. She wore her hair in two
    large curls in front and a thick fine plait turned up behind. The
    Empress (or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>Duchess as she is now called) was never before in England.
    She is only 21 and is very pleasing. She has beautiful blue eyes, and
    has a fine tall figure. She has black hair and wore ringlets in front
    and a plait behind. She was simply dressed in a grey watered moire
    trimmed with blonde. Their Majesties arrived at Portsmouth from Havre
    on the morning of the 8th of September; and proceeded to Windsor on
    the 10th, on a visit to the King and Queen, from whence they returned
    last Saturday, and they intend leaving Portsmouth to-day at 2 o’clock
    for Lisbon. The Queen and Duchess having desired us to sit down, talked
    some time with us. The Duchess then went and fetched her little girl, a
    child of 21 months old. We soon after went, the Queen leading Mamma and
    the Duchess me in the same manner as before. We returned in the same
    way. We lunched on board the <cite>Emerald</cite> and then were towed by the
    <cite>Messenger</cite> home. We came home at 3....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 14th October.</i>— ... Ferdinand the 7th of Spain<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> died
    on the 29th of September, and his young and lovely Queen Christina
    instantly became Regent for the infant Queen Isabella the 2nd, her
    daughter, and who is only 3 years old. The Queen has a powerful enemy
    in Don Carlos and his wife, but she is very courageous and very clever.
    It is a singular coincidence that there should be a young Queen in
    Spain as well as in Portugal. At 7 we 4 dined. I stayed up till 9....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 9th December.</i>—At 5 we dined. Sir John dined here. At
    ½ past 6 we went to the play to Drury Lane with Lady Conroy, Lehzen,
    and Sir John. It was Shakespear’s tragedy of <cite>King John</cite>. The
    principal characters were: King John, Mr. Macready,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> who acted

    Faucit<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>; the Lady Constance, Mrs. Sloman; Blanche of Castile, Miss
    Murray. The second piece was the melo-drama of <cite>The Innkeeper’s
    Daughter</cite>, which is very horrible but <em>extremely interesting</em>,
    but it would take me too much time to relate the story of it. The
    characters were: Richard, Mr. Cooper, who acted <em>very well</em>;
    Frankland, Mr. Ayliffe; Monkton, Mr. Thompson; Langley, Mr. Tayleure;
    Harrop, Mr. Webster,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> who looked <em>horrid</em> but acted well;
    he was one of the leading characters in the play; Edward Harrop, Mr.
    Richardson; Wentworth, Mr. Baker; Hans Ketzler, Mr. T. P. Cooke, who
    acted very well; Tricksey, Mr. Hughes; William, Mr. Howell; White, Mr.
    East; Smith, Mr. Henry; Allsop, Mr. S. Jones; Mary, Miss Kelly,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
    who acted <em>quite beautifully</em>; she is quite mature. Marian, Mrs.
    Broad. We came to the very beginning and stayed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>to the very end. We
    came home at 10 minutes past 12. I was <span class="smcap">very much amused</span>....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 26th December.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9
    we breakfasted. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Captain Burnes who
    has lately travelled over Northern East India. He gave us some very
    interesting accounts. He likewise brought with him to show us, his
    servant, a native of Cabul, dressed in his native dress. He is called
    Gulam Hussein; is of a dark olive complexion and had a dress of real
    Cashmere made in the beautiful valley of Cashmere.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 27th December.</i>—At ½ past 2 came Mr. T. Griffiths to
    lecture on Physics. The plan of the lecture was: Introductory—Objects
    of Alchymy, viz. Transmutation of Metals, the Elixir of Life, and the
    Universal Solvent;—Objects of Chemistry, viz. the investigation of
    every substance in nature—Chemistry a science of experiment—Results of
    chemical action—Arts and Manufactures dependent on chemistry—Importance
    of Heat as a chemical agent—Its action on various substances—Conductors
    and Non-conductors of Heat—Nature of Flame. All these different
    subjects were illustrated by very curious and interesting experiments.
    It was over at ½ past 3. Lehzen, Lady Conroy, Victoire, the Dean, and
    Sir John were likewise present. I was <em>very much amused</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 30th December.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9
    we breakfasted. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came Mr. Walker to
    lecture. The plan of the lecture was: Properties of Matter—Particles
    infinitely small, divisible, and hard—Cohesion—Capillary attraction,
    Magnetic attraction, &amp;c., &amp;c.—Repulsion exhibited in various ways,
    as counteracting the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>preceding influences—Recapitulation—Mechanics:
    Gravity considered, its effects on descending and projected
    bodies—National weights and measures—Vis inertia, momentum,
    what—Mechanical Powers, explained by various machines, applications,
    &amp;c. &amp;c.—Draft of horses—Defect of wheel carriages, road, &amp;c. pointed
    out—Some improvements suggested—Removal of Great Stone of St.
    Petersburg. The lecture lasted till a ¼ to 4. Lehzen, Lady Conroy,
    the Dean, and Sir John were present besides ourselves. At a ¼ to 7 we
    dined. Sir John dined here. At a ¼ past 8 we went with Lehzen, Lady
    Conroy, and Sir John to the play to Covent Garden. We came in for the
    last scene of <cite>Gustavus</cite>, the Masqued Ball, and stayed the whole
    of the pantomime, which is called “<cite>Old Mother Hubbard and her Dog;
    or Harlequin and Tales of the Nursery</cite>.” The scenery was very pretty
    and the principal characters were: Venus, Miss Lee; Cupid, Miss Poole
    who appeared in three other dresses: as a peasant boy, as a drummer,
    and as Mother Hubbard, and she looked <em>very</em> pretty and acted
    very well indeed. Old Mother Hubbard, Mr. Wieland; Schock (her dog),
    Master W. Mitchinson. The Duchess Griffinwinkle Blowsabella (afterwards
    Pantaloon), Mr. Barnes. King Rundytundy O (afterwards Dandy Lover),

    pretty person, Miss Foster. Prince Percineth (afterwards Harlequin) Mr.
    Ellar. Head Cook (afterwards Clown) Mr. T. Mathews. The panorama at the
    end was also pretty.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> year 1834 was spent very quietly by Princess Victoria. Her
      education progressed in simple and placid grooves, but her visits
      to the opera and the theatre became more frequent. She became
      devoted to Italian opera, and formed an attachment to music of the
      Italian school from which even Prince Albert, steeped as he was in
      German music, never contrived to wean her. She accepted then, and
      ever afterwards, Giulia Grisi as the supreme singer and artist.
      From the month of June, when she was present at a Festival in
      Westminster Abbey, to the end of the autumn, she devoted herself,
      at St. Leonards and at Tunbridge Wells, to the study of music and
      singing and to practising upon the harp.</p>

    <p>This year the Whig Ministry of Lord Grey tottered and fell. In July
      King William, much to the surprise of politicians on both sides,
      entrusted Lord Melbourne with the formation of a Government. The
      King wanted a coalition and made a tentative effort to achieve it,
      but he did not succeed in obtaining the co-operation of either
      Party. It was not anticipated that Lord Melbourne’s Government
      could last. In the month of November Lord Spencer died, and Lord
      Althorp, his son, who was Chancellor of the Exchequer, seized with
      unrestrained delight the opportunity to retire from public life.
      Lord Melbourne thereupon resigned, and Sir Robert Peel, returning
      hurriedly from Rome, formed an administration likewise destined to
      be short-lived.</p>

    <p>If King William had some difficulty in finding a stable Ministry,
      his brother-monarch across the Channel was in no better plight.
      The Parliamentary difficulties in France reached a stage of such
      complexity, that it looked for a moment as if the French monarchy
      itself might succumb to the vehemence of political and partisan
      strife. The Citizen-King found it necessary to employ 100,000
      troops to keep in awe the three cities of Paris, Marseilles, and
      Lyons. At this moment died Lafayette, one of the last links between
      the opening and concluding discords of the French Revolution. It
      was during this year that two foreigners of eminence, long resident
      in England, finally disappeared from London society. Princess
      Lieven left the Russian, and Talleyrand the French Embassy.</p>

    <p>This year, too, saw the destruction, by fire, of the old Houses
      of Parliament, associated with so many historic memories. None of
      these events, however, caused a ripple upon the surface of the
      little Princess’s secluded life at Kensington.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER III<br>1834</div>

  <p><i>Thursday, 16th January.</i>—About a fortnight or three weeks ago I
    received the Order of Maria Louisa, accompanied by a very flattering
    letter from Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, in the name of her
    daughter Queen Isabel the 2nd. Having some time ago asked for the
    handwriting of Her Majesty for my collection, the Queen hearing of it,
    sent me the Order accompanied by a very gracious letter. The Order is a
    violet and white ribbon, to which is suspended (en négligé) an enamel
    sort of star, and in high dress one superbly studded with diamonds.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 13th April.</i>—At 10 we went to prayers with Lady
    Theresa<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and Lehzen. The service was performed by the Dean, who
    gave us likewise a very good sermon. It was taken from the 3rd chapter
    of Acts, 23rd verse: “For Moses truly said unto the fathers, a Prophet
    shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto
    me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
    And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that
    prophet, shall be destroyed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>from among the people.” At 1 we lunched.
    At 7 we 3 and Lady Theresa also dined. After dinner came Aunt Sophia. I
    stayed up till a ¼ to 9.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 14th April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At ½
    past 8 we all breakfasted. As I am now about to return to my usual
    studies, I must not omit to mention how very anxious my dear Mamma was
    throughout my indisposition, and how unceasing <em>dear</em> Lehzen was
    in her attentions and care to me....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 19th April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At 9 we
    breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till ½ past 10. At 12 we
    went out walking. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came the Duchess of
    Northumberland. At 3 came Lady Robert Grosvenor<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> with her little
    girl Victoria. She is a dear little child, so clever and intelligent.
    At 4 came Mrs. Anderson till 5. At 6 we dined. At a ¼ past 7 we went
    with Lady Conroy, Lehzen and Sir John to the Opera. We came in just
    at the beginning of the Opera of <cite>Anna Boulena</cite>. The characters
    were: Anna Boulena, Mdlle. Guiletta Grisi.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> She is a most beautiful
    singer and actress and is likewise very young and pretty. She sang
    <em>beautifully</em> throughout but particularly in the last scene
    when she is mad, which she <em>acted</em> likewise <em>beautifully</em>.
    Giovanna Seymour, Mrs. E. Seguin, who sings very well. Enrico, Signor
    Tambourini, who sang beautifully. Ricardo Percy, M. Ivanhoff, who sings
    very well. He has a very pleasing though not a very strong voice.
    Between the acts there was a divertissement, in which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>Mdlle. Theresa
    Elsler danced a pas de deux with Mons. T. Guerinot, and Mdlle. Fanny
    Elsler with M. Perrot. Mdlle. Fanny danced beautifully; she ran up
    the stage on the tips of her toes in a most extraordinary manner. She
    likewise made many other pretty little steps. M. Perrot (whom I had
    never seen before) danced likewise quite beautifully. We went away as
    soon as the 2nd act of the opera was over. We came home at 12. I was
    <span class="smcap">very much amused indeed</span>!...</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 26th April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8.
    At 9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till 11. The Duchess
    of Northumberland was present. At 12 we went to pay a visit to Aunt
    Gloucester. At 1 we lunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. At 4 came
    Mrs. Anderson till 5. At 6 we dined. Sir John dined here. At a ¼ past
    7 we went with Lehzen and Sir John to the Opera. We came in just at
    the beginning of the opera of <cite>Otello</cite>. The characters were:
    Otello, Signor Rubini who sang quite beautifully and acted very well.
    Iago, Signor Tambourini who sung likewise <em>beautifully</em>. Rodrigo,
    M. Ivanhoff who sung <em>very well</em>.——Signor Zuchello. Desdemona,
    Signora Giuletta Grisi. She <em>sang</em> and <em>acted</em> quite
    beautifully! and looked lovely. She acted and sang <em>most sweetly and
    beautifully</em> in the last scene; and also in the two trios in the 1st
    and 2nd acts. When the opera was over she was called for, and she came
    on, led by Rubini. At that moment a wreath of roses with a small roll
    of paper inside was thrown on the stage; Rubini picked it up and placed
    it on her head. They were very much applauded. We came away directly
    after the opera. Lord Ilchester<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> and Lady <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>Theresa joined us there.
    We came home at a ¼ to 12. I was <span class="smcap">very much amused indeed</span>!!!...</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 28th April.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At a ¼
    to 9 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 came the Dean till a ¼ past 11. The
    Duchess of Northumberland was present. At 12 Lehzen and I drove out. At
    1 we lunched. At 3 came Mr. Steward till 4. I then went to the painting
    room. At 7 we dined. After dinner while we were playing on the piano,
    arrived Uncle Ferdinand<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and Charles.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Uncle Ferdinand is
    Mamma’s second brother and she had not seen him for <em>16 years</em>! I
    have now seen all my uncles, except Uncle Mensdorff<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> (Aunt Sophie’s
    husband), for Mamma’s eldest brother, Uncle Ernest,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> was here 3
    years ago, the same year Uncle Leopold went to Belgium. Charles is
    looking very well and is grown much fatter. Uncle Ferdinand is not at
    all like my other Uncles. He is fair. It is a great pleasure for me to
    see both Uncle Ferdinand and Charles. I stayed up till 9....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 5th June.</i>—At 11 arrived my <span class="smcap">dearest</span> sister
    Feodora whom I had not seen for <em>6 years</em>. She is accompanied by
    Ernest, her husband, and her two eldest children Charles and Eliza.
    Dear Feodora looks very well but is grown much stouter since I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>saw
    her. She was married on the 18th of February 1828 and went away to
    Germany a week after and she never came here again since. Hohenlohe
    looks also very well. As for the children they are the <span class="smcap">dearest</span>
    little loves I ever saw. Charles is 4 years and a half old. He is very
    tall and is a sweet good-tempered little fellow. He is not handsome
    but he is a very nice-looking boy. He has light blue eyes and fair
    hair. Eliza is 3 years and a half old; she is also very tall and is a
    <em>perfect</em> little beauty. She has immense dark brown eyes and a
    very small mouth and light brown hair. She is very clever and amusing.
    We then showed her their rooms, and afterwards, at ½ past 12, we went
    to see the dear children take their dinner. They took it with Mr.
    Rol, Charles’s tutor. At 1 we all lunched, that is to say, Mamma,
    dear Feodore, Ernst Hohenlohe, Charly, Lehzen, and I. After luncheon,
    Feodore and the others went upstairs. At 2 Charles and Eliza came down
    and stayed with us alone. They are <em>dear sweet</em> children; not at
    all shy and <em>so</em> good; they never hurt or spoil anything. At a
    little after 2 came Lady Westminster.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> The <em>dear</em> children
    behaved <em>so</em> well. They are so very sensible. They staid till
    after 3. Eliza speaks German and French very nicely. She has a French
    Swiss bonne called Louise who speaks French with her. At ½ past 4 we
    went out driving with <em>dear</em> Feodore and Lehzen. We came home at
    6. At 7 we dined. Besides dearest Feodore, Ernest, Charles and Lehzen,
    Sir J. Conroy dined here. When the 2nd course was put on, Charles and
    Eliza came in, and staid there. They were very funny and amusing and
    talked immensely. They staid up till ½ past 8. At ½ past 9 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>we
    went to the Opera with Ernst Hohenlohe, Charles, Lehzen, and Sir John
    Conroy, poor <em>dear</em> Feodora being too tired to go. We came in at
    about the middle of the 2nd act of Rossini’s Opera of <cite>L’Assiedo di
    Corrinto</cite>. It is in 3 acts. The principal characters are: Mahomet
    (Emperor of the Turks), Signor Tamburini, who sang beautifully and
    looked <em>very well</em>. Cleomene (Governor of Corrinto), Mons.
    Ivanoff who likewise sang very well. Nioclene, Signor Rubini who
    also sang quite beautifully. Pamira, Mdlle. Giuletta Grisi, who sang
    quite beautifully and acted and looked <em>extremely well</em>. It was
    Laporte’s benefit, and the first time this opera was ever performed
    in this country. Then followed the 2nd act of <cite>La Sylphide</cite> in
    which Taglioni made her first appearance since an absence of some
    months. She danced quite beautifully, quite as if she flew in the air,
    so gracefully and lightly. She looked also very well. There was also
    a Pas de Trois danced by Mdlles. Theresa and Fanny Elsler and Mons.
    Theodore. Mdlle. Fanny danced <em>beautifully</em>. We came home at 10
    minutes to 1. There is only one thing wanting to my happiness in being
    with my dear sister and her children, that is that I cannot share
    that happiness with one whom I love so very dearly but who is far far
    away—that is my <em>most dear</em> Uncle Ferdinand....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 11th June.</i>—<em>Dear</em> little Eliza and Charles came
    down to breakfast. Eliza came into my room and staid with me for some
    time. She is a dear good little girl. At 1 we lunched. Eliza came again
    into my room and staid with me for nearly an hour. At 3 we went with
    Lady Flora Hastings<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and Lehzen to Windsor on a visit to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>their
    Majesties. We were very sorry to leave the dear children. At a ¼ past
    5 we arrived at Windsor. The Queen, <em>dear</em> Feodore, Ernest and
    several ladies and gentlemen of the court, received us at the door and
    conducted us upstairs to the Queen’s room, where the King was. I was
    very happy to see my <em>dear</em> sister again. Some time afterwards
    the Queen conducted us to our rooms which are very handsome. At 7 we
    dined. Besides the King and Queen, Feodore and Ernest, Mamma and I,
    Lady Flora and Lehzen, there dined there: George Cambridge, the Duke
    and Duchess of Richmond,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> the Duchess of Northumberland, the Duke
    of Grafton,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> the Duke of Dorset,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
    the Duke of Cleveland,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
    the Marquis and Marchioness of Conyngham,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> Lady Clinton (Lady of
    the Bedchamber in Waiting), Lord and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>Lady Frederick Fitzclarence,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
    Lord Denbigh,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Lady Sophia Sidney,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
    Miss Eden,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Miss Hope
    Johnston, Miss Wilson, Lord Albemarle,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Sir Frederick Watson,
    Colonel Lygon,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Mr. Wood,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
    &amp;c., &amp;c. The Queen went first with
    Ernest, then came the King who led Mamma and I in, and then came
    Feodore with the Duke of Richmond. The rest I do not recollect. I sat
    between the King and the Duke of Dorset. I stayed up till ½ past 9.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 12th June.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to 8. At
    ½ past 9 we breakfasted, with the King, the Queen, Feodore, Ernest,
    George Cambridge, the Duchess of Northumberland, and Lady Clinton. All
    the other ladies breakfasted together. We then went into the Queen’s
    room. At a ¼ past 12 we went to Ascot Races with the whole company in 9
    carriages. In the first went the King, the Queen, Mamma and I. In the
    second Feodore, the Duchess of Richmond, the Duchess of Northumberland
    and Lady Clinton. In the third Lady Flora, Lady Sophia Sydney, the Duke
    of Richmond, and the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>Duke of Cleveland. In the fourth Lehzen, Miss
    Hope Johnston, the Duke of Grafton, and the Duke of Dorset. How all the
    others went I do not know. At about 1 we arrived on the race course and
    entered the King’s stand with all our party. The races were very good
    and there was an immense concourse of people there of all ranks. At
    about ½ past 2 we had luncheon. At a little after 6 we left the stand
    and returned to the castle in the same way as we came except that, as
    it rained very hard, we came home in shut carriages. At 7 we arrived at
    the castle. At ½ past 7 we dined. The company at dinner were the same
    as yesterday with the exception of Lord and Lady Conyngham not dining
    here, and a few other gentlemen having dined here. We went in in the
    same way. I sat between the King and the Duke of Cleveland. I stayed up
    till a ¼ to 11. I was very much amused indeed at the races....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 27th July.</i>—At 9 we breakfasted. How sad I felt at
    breakfast not to see the door open and <span class="smcap">dear</span> Feodore come in
    smiling and leading her dear little girl; and not to get the accustomed
    morning kiss from her. At 11 we went to the chapel with Lehzen, Lady
    Conroy, and Victoire. The Bishop of London preached a very fine sermon.
    Victoire Conroy stayed till ½ past 2. At 1 we lunched. I missed dear
    Feodore here again terribly. I miss her so much to-day. She used to
    be with me so much on Sunday always. We used to talk together so
    pleasantly. Last Sunday afternoon she painted in my room. At ½ past
    3 we went with Lehzen to visit Aunt Gloucester, and then drove home
    through the park. How dull that drive appeared to me without dear
    Feodore. We came home at ½ past 5. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>At 7 we dined. After dinner came
    Aunt Sophia. We passed a sad dull evening. I stayed up till a ¼ to 9....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 5th October.</i>— ... The news were received a few days
    ago that Dom Pedro, Regent of Portugal,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> was dead. He expired on
    the 24th instant, at the age of 35. His daughter, Donna Maria, the
    young Queen, though only 15, is declared of age and able to govern
    by herself. The lovely young Empress is left a widow at the age of
    22 only. It is a sad situation both for the young Queen and the poor
    Empress, in whom both I take the greatest interest as I know them
    personally. I saw Dom Pedro when he was in England about 3 years ago.
    At 11 we went to church. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 3 we went out
    driving with Lady Flora and Lehzen, in the pony-carriage. We came home
    in the large carriage at 6. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire,
    Sir J., Messrs. E., S., and H. C. dined here. I stayed up till ½ past
    9....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">St. Leonards</span>, <i>Wednesday, 4th November</i>.—I said in my
    last journal book that I would describe in this book all what passed
    yesterday. We reached Battle Abbey at about a ¼ to 1. We were received
    at the door by Lady Webster.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Battle Abbey was built by King
    William the Conqueror and stands on the site where the famous battle of
    Hastings was fought. The place is still preserved where Harold fell.
    She showed us first into a large hall supposed to be the highest in
    England. There are portraits of King <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>Charles the 2nd, King William the
    3rd, and Queen Anne in it, &amp;c. &amp;c. There is also a very large picture
    of the battle of Hastings. Some old suits of armour are also in the
    hall. We saw also what were the cloisters now turned into a room. We
    saw the Beggars’ Hall, a curious walk of the monks, and the garden.
    We lastly partook of some refreshment in a very pretty room in which
    there was a picture of the Emperor Napoleon, not full length, only to
    the waist; which is said to be very like. The outside of the abbey
    is very fine too. We left it again at ½ past 1. The tenants again
    accompanied us till Broadeslowe. There some gentlemen from Hastings
    met us and accompanied us to St. Leonards. We passed under an arch
    formed of laurels and decorated with flowers and inscriptions. As soon
    as we passed the 2nd arch the Mayor got out of his carriage and came
    to our door asking leave to precede us in his carriage. An immense
    concourse of people walking with the carriage. The mayor and aldermen
    preceding us in carriages as also a band of music. Throughout Hastings
    the houses were decorated with flowers, ribands and inscriptions, and
    arches of flowers and laurels. Ladies and children waving handkerchiefs
    and laurels on the balconies and at the windows. Cries of “Welcome,
    welcome, Royal visitors,” were constantly heard. We reached Hastings at
    ½ past 2, and it was 4 o’clock before we arrived at our house at St.
    Leonards. It was indeed a most splendid reception. We stepped out on
    the balcony and were loudly cheered. One sight was extremely pretty.
    Six fishermen in rough blue jackets, red caps and coarse white aprons,
    preceded by a band, bore a basket ornamented with flowers, full of fish
    as a present for us. We found <em>dear</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>Dashy in perfect health. Our
    house is very comfortable. At 6 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire,
    Messrs. E., S., H., and Sir J. C. dined here. After 8 the fireworks
    began and lasted till 9. They were very fine. I stayed up till 9.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 5th November.</i>—I awoke this morning at 7 and got up at
    ½ past 7. At 9 we breakfasted. At 12 Mamma received an address from the
    Mayor, Corporation, and Inhabitants of Hastings and St. Leonards. After
    1 we lunched. At 7 we dined. Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Messrs. E.,
    S., and Sir J. C. dined here.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 11th November.</i>— ... At ½ past 11 we went out driving
    in the barouche with Lady Flora and Lehzen. We got out and walked and
    sent the barouche home. We afterwards got into the close landau with
    a postilion and horse in hand. As we came to the commencement of the
    town where a seminary is to be built, the hand-horse kicked up and
    getting entangled in the traces fell down, pulling the other with it;
    the horse with the postilion however instantly recovered itself but the
    other remained on the ground kicking and struggling most violently. Two
    gentlemen very civilly came and held the horse’s head down while we
    all got out as fast as possible. I called for poor dear little Dashy
    who was in the rumble; Wood (our footman) took him down and I ran on
    with him in my arms calling Mamma to follow, Lehzen and Lady Flora
    followed us also. They then cut the traces, the horse still struggling
    violently. The other horse which had been quite quiet, being frightened
    by the other’s kicking, backed and fell over into a foundation pit,
    while Wood held him, and he (Wood) with difficulty prevented himself
    from falling; the horse recovering <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>himself ran after us and we
    instantly ran behind a low stone wall; but the horse went along the
    road, and a workman took him and gave him to Wood. The other horse
    had ceased kicking and got up. We ought to be <em>most grateful</em> to
    Almighty God for His merciful providence in thus preserving us, for it
    was a <em>very narrow escape</em>. Both Wood and Bacleberry behaved very
    well indeed. The names of the two gentlemen who held the horse’s head
    are Rev. Mr. Gould and Mr. Peckham Micklethwaite.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The latter I
    am sorry to say was hurt, but not very materially. The poor horse is
    cut from head to foot; but the other is not at all hurt only very much
    frightened. We walked home....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 30th November.</i>— ... We went to church with Lady Flora
    and Lehzen. Mr. Randolph preached a most beautiful sermon. It was taken
    from the 6th chapter of St. Paul’s 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians, 1st
    and 2nd verses. “We then, as workers together with Him, beseech you
    also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. For He saith, I
    have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I
    succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the
    day of salvation.” At 1 we lunched. At 3 came Victoire Conroy till a ¼
    past 6. At 7 we dined. Jane, Victoire, Messrs. E., H., and Sir J. C.
    dined here.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 2nd December.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7.
    We received this morning the news that my poor Uncle, the Duke of
    Gloucester,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>dead. He expired on Sunday evening, the 30th
    of November, 1834, at 20 minutes to 7. I am very sorry that we have
    lost him as he was always a <em>most affectionate</em> and <em>kind</em>
    Uncle to me. Aunt Mary, I hear, bears her loss wonderfully. Poor Aunt
    Sophia Matilda, his only sister and who was excessively fond of him, is
    dreadfully distressed at losing her only brother. But her piety will
    enable her to bear this great loss. He was so kind to think of us the
    morning before he died. Aunt S. Matilda told him that we had asked how
    he was, upon which he answered, “Tell them that I say, God bless them,
    and that I love them.” This kind message proved the quiet state of mind
    he was in. He showed such piety, such peace and resignation, that that
    proved a great comfort to his poor sister. He was in his 59th year....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 23rd December.</i>— ... I received from <em>dear</em> Uncle
    Leopold this morning some most interesting autographs which are: Louis
    Seize’s, Marie Antoinette’s, Henri IV.’s, the Duke of Marlborough’s,
    the Empress Maria Theresa’s and her husband’s, and Lafayette’s....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 28th December.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 20 minutes to
    8. At 9 we breakfasted. At 11 we went to church with Lady Flora and
    Lehzen. Mr. Randolph preached a very fine sermon. It was taken from the
    1st chapter of St. Matthew, 21st verse: “And she shall bring forth a
    Son, and thou shalt call His name Jesus: for He shall save His people
    from their sins.” At ½ past 1 we lunched. I forgot to mention that I
    received this morning a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>very kind letter from dear Uncle Leopold,
    accompanied by a beautiful shawl and the autographs of Louis XV., his
    Queen, Marie Leczinska, and the Dauphin, father to Louis XVI. At ½ past
    2 we went out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and came home after 3....</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER IV</h2>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Princess attached importance to this year of her life. It
      appeared to her that she benefited more fully by her lessons,
      and began to realise their importance. About a month after her
      birthday she was confirmed at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s, by the
      Archbishop of Canterbury. She was impressed by the solemnity of
      the occasion and frightened by the austerity of Archbishop Howley.
      This year marked an epoch in ways other than spiritual. She was
      allowed more freely to mix with her mother’s guests. Personages of
      distinction were asked to meet her, and she had an opportunity of
      seeing some of the more eminent of those who were to be her future
      subjects, although she had scant opportunity of getting to know
      them well.</p>

    <p>She went to Ascot this year in the Royal Procession, and then,
      in the autumn, her mother arranged for her a Progress on the
      lines of that which is recorded in her Journals of 1832. There
      is nothing, however, to show that she was alive to the trend of
      public events. The existence of Lord Melbourne’s second Ministry
      was precarious. It was said that Lord Melbourne had against him the
      King, the Church, the Bar, the Agricultural and Monied interest,
      and a large minority in the House of Commons; whereas he only
      had in his favour a small majority in the House of Commons, the
      manufacturing towns, and a portion of the rabble. This was the Tory
      analysis of the political situation in 1835. “Threatened men and
      threatened Ministries enjoy a long life,” and Lord Melbourne’s was
      no exception.</p>

    <p>The Princess was in frequent communication by letter with her
      Uncle, King Leopold. He sent her many interesting autographs for
      the collection she at that time was forming. They corresponded
      about books. It was he who recommended her Sully’s <cite>Memoirs</cite>,
      which, as her Journals show, she assiduously read, and he now
      and then referred in admonitory terms to her future regal
      responsibilities and duties.</p>

    <p>On one occasion he sent her an extract from a French Memoir
      containing a severe criticism on the political character of Queen
      Anne, to which she replied that as he had endeavoured to point out
      to her what a Queen “ought not to be,” she hoped he would give her
      some idea of what a Queen “ought to be.” Those who are familiar
      with the character and disposition of King Leopold can imagine that
      he responded willingly to the invitation. It was upon this note
      that the year 1835 came to an end.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER IV<br>1835</div>

  <p><i>Monday, 5th January.</i>—I quite forgot to mention that on the
    morning of the 20th of November a ship laden with either coal or chalk
    sank, but all the crew came off safe. Lieutenant Gilley and five men
    put off in a boat from the 3rd Martello Tower, in hopes of being able
    to save some of the goods of the sunken ship. The sea was very high,
    the boat slight and over-loaded, and they had scarcely left the shore
    when the boat was upset and they were <em>all six drowned</em>! The
    poor sister of the Lieutenant is residing here. Three of the poor
    men were married and left their poor widows (all young) plunged in
    the greatest grief. The body of Weeks, one of the married men and
    who had 3 children, was found two days after, at Pevensey. The poor
    Lieutenant’s body was only found last Sunday, the 28th December, quite
    near here; and one of the other married men, called Conely, who had 4
    children, was found the next morning near Hastings; and Andrews, the
    last married man, who had only been married a very short time, was
    found on Wednesday night, the 31st December, in the same place. It was
    a great gratification to the poor widows that their husbands’ bodies
    have been found. We saw two of them at a distance the other day. They
    are all very decent-looking, tidy and nice <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>people. At a ¼ to 12 we
    went out walking with Lehzen till 1. As we walked along by the towers
    we met Mrs. Weeks, one of the widows, with her little girl. She had a
    widow-cap and bonnet on, and a Scotch cloak. She looks as pale as death
    but has a mild sweet expression....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 24th January.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ past 8.
    At ½ past 9 we breakfasted. At 10 came the Dean till 20 minutes to 11.
    It was yesterday <em>15 years</em> that it pleased God to take my <em>most
    beloved</em> Papa from us. Alas! <em>I</em> was but 6 months when this
    affliction came upon us; and I therefore never had the happiness to
    know him....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 27th January.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 7, got up at a ¼
    past 8. At ½ past 9 we breakfasted. At 1 we lunched. I ought to have
    mentioned that besides my lessons with the Dean (and also when my other
    masters come) I have many occupations with Lehzen. And now, though we
    are all in the bustle of packing, I am constantly employed by myself in
    various ways; and I read French History to Lehzen, and one of Racine’s
    tragedies with her in the afternoons which I delight in. I <em>love</em>
    to be <em>employed</em>; I <em>hate</em> to be <em>idle</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 29th January.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 5 and got up at
    7. At 8 we all breakfasted. At a ¼ to 9 we left St. Leonards. Dear
    Lehzen, Lady Flora, Lady Conroy &amp;c. following in another carriage.
    All our acquaintances were out to see us go (except Mr. and Lady Mary
    Dundas).... For some reasons I am sorry we have left St. Leonards,
    which are, the nice walks, the absence of fogs, and looking out of my
    window and seeing the people walk on the esplanade, and seeing the sun
    rise and set, which was quite beautiful. The rising began by the sky
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>being quite pink and blending softly into a bright blue, and the sun
    rose by degrees from a little red streak to a ball of red copper. The
    setting began by the whole horizon being orange, crimson and blue,
    and the sun sunk down a ball of fiery gold dyeing the sands crimson.
    But then again my reasons for <em>not</em> being sorry to go are, my
    not sleeping well there, my not having been well, and the roaring of
    the sea. We changed horses first at Battle, then at Stony Crouch,
    then at Woodgate, which was quite near <em>dear</em> Tunbridge, then at
    Sevenoaks, and lastly at Bromley. We reached Kensington Palace at 5.
    My room is very prettily newly papered, newly furnished, and has a new
    carpet, and looks very pretty indeed. Our bedroom also newly papered
    and furnished and looks very nice and clean. Pedro and my dear little
    wax-bills came quite safe. Dear Dashy was in our carriage and behaved
    like a darling....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 6th April.</i>—The melancholy news were received yesterday
    of the death of the Prince Augustus, Duke of Leuchtenberg,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> which
    happened on the 28th of March. It is a <em>most lamentable</em> and
    dreadful event. His Royal Highness was in his 25th year, and in the
    flower of his age. Young, amiable, good and well-meaning; for since his
    arrival at Lisbon he had won the hearts of many by his affability and
    good-nature. He caught a cold, which he neglected and it ended in the
    quinsy. It is really quite dreadful for the poor young Queen, who is
    now left a widow at the early age of 16! Her Majesty completed her 16th
    year on the 4th of this month. It is likewise dreadful for his amiable
    and accomplished sister the young Empress-widow, who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>is still in
    mourning for her husband, Dom Pedro; and also dreadful for his mother,
    the Duchess of Leuchtenberg. Not two months ago he was seen leading his
    young bride from the altar, and now all that prospect of happiness is
    cut off!...</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 2nd May.</i>— ... At 6 we dined. Lady Flora dined here.
    At a ¼ past 7 we went to the opera with dear Lehzen and Lady Flora. It
    was Rossini’s opera seria of <cite>Otello</cite> in 3 acts. The characters
    were: Desdemona, Mdlle. Grisi, who looked <span class="smcap">beautiful</span> and
    sung <span class="smcap">most exquisitely</span> and acted <span class="smcap">beautifully</span>. She
    personates the meek and ill-treated Desdemona in a most <em>perfect</em>
    and <em>touching</em> manner. Elmiro (a Venetian patrician and father
    to Desdemona), Signor Lablache who sang and acted beautifully.... The
    finest parts are: the song which Otello sings in the 1st scene of the
    1st act, and which Rubini sang beautifully. The duet between Iago and
    Roderigo in the 1st act which Tamburini and Ivanoff sang beautifully
    together. The song which Desdemona sings when she first comes on in
    the first act, which begins “Stanca di più combattere,” and which
    Grisi sung <em>most exquisitely</em>! (It is not by Rossini; it is
    composed expressly for Grisi by Marliani.) The Finale to the 1st act
    which commences with that beautiful trio, “Ti parli l’amore,” between
    Elmiro, Roderigo, and Desdemona, which Lablache, Ivanoff and Grisi
    sang most beautifully. It was enchored. And when Otello comes on and
    declares her to be his wife and Elmiro in his rage exclaims: “Empia!
    ti maledico!” and which Lablache did in a manner <em>most splendid</em>
    while Desdemona falls at his feet. The Duet between Iago and Otello in
    the 2nd act which Tamburini and Rubini sang most beautifully. The duet
    between <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>Roderigo and Otello which follows it and which was likewise
    beautifully sung. When Desdemona enquires from the people if Otello
    (who had fought with Roderigo) still lives, and when she exclaims in
    delight: “Altro non chiede il cor,” and which Grisi did in a most
    splendid manner; and when at the end of the 3rd act she kneels before
    her father and says, “L’error d’un infelice pietoso in me perdona: Se
    il padre m’abbandona, da chi sperar pieta?” which she did in a most
    touching manner. The song in the 3rd act with the harp which Grisi
    sung most <em>beautifully</em>, as also the prayer; and when Otello
    comes on to stab her and she reproaches him exclaiming: “Uccidimi se
    vuoi, perfido, ingrato”; which Grisi did in such a mild and pathetic
    manner. He then stabs her and immediately afterwards himself. Grisi and
    Rubini were called out and were loudly applauded. We came in before
    the overture was begun and came away directly after the opera was
    over. It is a beautiful opera and I like it much better than <cite>Anna
    Boulena</cite>....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 6th May.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past
    9 we breakfasted. At 11 we set off with Lady Flora and Lehzen for
    Windsor Castle, where we arrived at ½ past 1. At 2 we all lunched;
    that is to say, besides the Queen, the Landgravine,<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and us
    two,—the Duchess of Northumberland, Lady Brownlow,<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Lady Sophia
    Cust, Lady De Lisle,<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
    Lady <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>Falkland,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Lady Flora, Lehzen,
    the Baroness de Stein, Miss Mitchel, Miss Hudson, Lord Howe,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and
    Lord Denbigh.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> At ½ past 2 we went out walking with the Queen, the
    Duchess of Northumberland, Lady Flora, Lady Sophia Cust, Lehzen, Miss
    Mitchel and Miss Hudson, Lord Howe, Lord Denbigh, Lord Brownlow, and
    Sir Andrew Bernard. We walked to Adelaide Cottage<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and all got into
    carriages except the gentlemen who rode. The Queen, Mamma, the Duchess
    and I were in one carriage, and all the rest followed in others. We
    came home at 6. At ½ past 7 we dined....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 7th May.</i>— ... At 12 we went all over the Castle with
    the King, the Queen, the Landgravine, the Duchess, Lady Brownlow, Lady
    Flora, Lehzen, Miss Mitchel, Lord Howe, Lord Denbigh, Lord Brownlow,
    and Sir Andrew Bernard....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 8th May.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At ½ past 8 we
    breakfasted. The Queen came and sat with us at breakfast. At ½ past 9
    we left Windsor with Lady Flora and Lehzen. I was very much pleased
    there, as both my Uncle and Aunt are <em>so very kind</em> to me....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 18th May.</i>— ... At 7 we 3 dined. ½ past 9 we went into
    the first large room (as in the preceding parties) and received the
    company (the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>list of which is adjoined). The singers which were
    Grisi, Rubini, Ivanoff, Tamburini, Lablache,<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> and Costa<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> for
    the piano, had just arrived. Our people were the same as the other
    day. When all the company had arrived which was at ½ past 10, we all
    went into the other room which was arranged with chairs all across
    the room for the people to sit on. We were in the first row with Aunt
    Sophia and the Duchess of Cambridge and quite close to the piano.
    Grisi is <em>quite beautiful</em> off the stage. She is not tall, and
    rather pale; and she has such a lovely mild expression in her face.
    Her face and neck has such a beautiful soft shape. She has such
    beautiful dark eyes with fine long eyelashes, a fine nose, and very
    sweet mouth. She was dressed in a white flowered silk, with blonde
    trimmings about the body and sleeves which reached to the elbows. Her
    beautiful dark hair was as usual quite flat in front with an amethyst
    bandeau round it, and a fine plait at the very back of her head. She
    is very quiet, ladylike and unaffected in her manners. I spoke to her,
    and she answered in a very pleasing manner. She has a very pretty
    expression when she speaks. Rubini is short and not good-looking.
    Ivanoff is also very short and has a very singular Calmuck face.
    Tamburini is short but very good-looking and gentlemanlike. Lablache
    does not look so tall off the stage <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>as he does on it, and is likewise
    very gentlemanlike. The concert began with a trio from <cite>L’Assiedo
    di Corrinto</cite>, “Destin terribile”; Grisi, Rubini and Ivanoff sang
    beautifully. Then Tamburini sang “Sorgete” from <cite>L’Assiedo</cite>
    beautifully. After this Lablache sang “Dove vai?” from <cite>Guillaume
    Tell</cite> beautifully. Then Grisi sang “Tanti affetti,” an aria from
    the <cite>Donna del Lago</cite>, most beautifully. Her <em>lovely</em> voice
    sounds beautiful in a room. Lablache and Tamburini then sang “Il rival
    salvar tu dei” most beautifully. It is from <cite>I Puritani</cite>. They
    sing beautifully together. Their two fine voices go so well together.
    Lablache’s voice is immensely powerful but not too much so (for my
    taste), <em>even</em> in a room. Tamburini’s too is most splendid. He
    is even a more skilful and finished singer than Lablache. Then came a
    trio “Allor che Scorre” from <cite>Guillaume Tell</cite>, between Rubini,
    Tamburini and Lablache, which they sang likewise extremely well. This
    ended the 1st act. Near the end of the 1st act Mme. Malibran arrived.
    She was dressed in white satin with a scarlet hat and feathers. She
    is shorter than Grisi and <em>not near so pretty</em>. We went into the
    refreshment room between the acts. We then sat down again and the 2nd
    act began with a <em>most lovely</em> polonaise, “Son Vergin vezzosa”
    from <cite>I Puritani</cite>, which Grisi sang most exquisitely, accompanied
    by all the singers except Malibran. Then Grisi and Tamburini sang
    “Che veggo oh Ciel,” from <cite>L’Assiedo</cite> most beautifully together.
    Malibran then sang a song by Persiani very well. Her low notes are
    <em>beautiful</em>, but her high notes are thick and not clear. <em>I</em>
    like <em>Grisi by far better</em> than her. Then Grisi and Rubini sang
    a beautiful duet “Artuor dove sai” from <cite>I Puritani</cite> by Bellini,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span><em>beautifully</em>. His voice is delightful in a room. It is so
    sweet and so full of expression. Malibran and Lablache then sang a
    buffa duet “Con pazienza supportiamo,” by Fioravente, beautifully.
    Lablache is <em>so</em> funny and <em>so</em> amusing. Lablache then sang a
    Neapolitan air (a buffa song) of his own composition and accompanying
    himself, <em>delightfully</em>. Then came a quartet “A te oh caro!” from
    the <cite>Puritani</cite>, which Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini, and Lablache
    sung beautifully. This ended the <em>most delightful concert I ever
    heard</em>. Aunt Sophia, who had <em>never</em> heard any of these singers
    before, was delighted; but no one could be <em>more enchanted</em> than
    <em>I</em> was. I shall never forget it. It was Mamma’s birthday present
    for me! Costa accompanied on the piano beautifully. I stayed up till 20
    minutes past 1. I was <span class="smcap">most exceedingly</span> delighted....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 24th May.</i>—Today is my <span class="smcap">16th</span> birthday! How
    very old that sounds; but I feel that the two years to come till I
    attain my 18th are the most important of any almost. I now only begin
    to appreciate my lessons, and hope from this time on, to make great
    progress. I awoke at ½ past 6. Mamma got up soon after and gave me a
    lovely brooch made of her own hair, a letter from herself, one from
    dearest Feodore with a nosegay, and a drawing and a pair of slippers
    done by her. I gave her a drawing I had done. Dear Lehzen gave me a
    lovely little leather box with knives, pencils &amp;c. in it, two small
    dictionaries and a very pretty print of Mdlle. Taglioni. Mamma gave her
    a pair of amethyst earrings and I gave her a penholder and a drawing
    done by myself. My maids Frances and Caroline gave me a pincushion done
    by Frances and a portefolio done by Caroline. Anne Mason (Lehzen’s
    maid) <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>gave a small flower vase with flowers. <em>Dashy</em> gave an
    ivory basket with barley-sugar and chocolate. At 9 we breakfasted.
    I then received my table. From my <span class="smcap">dear</span> Mamma I received a
    lovely enamel bracelet with her hair, a pair of fine china vases,
    a lovely shawl and some English and Italian books. From dearest
    Feodore a lovely enamel bracelet with hers and the children’s hair;
    from Charles some pretty prints; from Späth a very pretty case for
    handkerchiefs embroidered in silver; from Sir Robert and Lady Gardiner
    a very pretty sort of china vase; from Sir J. Conroy a writing-case;
    from the whole Conroy family some prints; and from Mr. George Hayter a
    beautiful drawing done by him. I quite forgot to say that I received
    a beautiful pair of sapphire and diamond earrings from the King and
    a beautiful prayer-book and very kind letter from the Queen. I also
    received a prayer-book from a bookseller of the name of Hatchard. At
    10 we went down to prayers with Lehzen and Charles. The service was
    performed by the Dean who gave us likewise a <em>very</em> good sermon.
    It was taken from the 24th chapter of Joshua, 15th verse: “And if
    it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord, choose ye this day whom ye
    will serve; but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.” After
    church, I received a Bible from Sir F. Trench<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> with a picture of
    Norris Castle painted on the margin; and also two small oil pictures
    from an old Mrs. Pakenham, done by a Mr. King. I also saw Mrs. Brock,
    Sarah (my former maid), and Mrs. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>Fletcher (our former housekeeper).
    At a ¼ to 1 came Aunt Sophia who gave me with Aunt Gloucester a very
    pretty diamond brooch. At 1 we lunched. At ½ past 2 came the Duchess of
    Northumberland, who gave me a very fine fillagree ornament in the shape
    of a flower, and another little fillagree ornament from Miss Wynn.
    Lady Flora, who gave me a pretty paper-knife and penholder of jasper
    from Arthur’s Seat, the rock which overhangs Edinburgh. Lady Theresa,
    who gave me a small pocket-book of her own work. Lady Catherine, who
    gave me a very fine velvet Music-book. Lady Cust, who gave me a very
    fine japanned box. Sir G. Anson who gave me a print; Sir Frederick
    Wetherall, who gave me a little china scent-bottle. Lady Conroy, Jane,
    and Victoire. At 3 came the Duke of Sussex, who gave me a gold bracelet
    with turquoises; and soon after Lady Charlotte St. Maur who gave me a
    purse of her own work. At a ¼ past 3 came the Landgravine who gave me a
    head-ornament of emeralds, and Aunt Augusta, who gave me a chrisoprase
    bracelet. At 4 came the Duchess of Cambridge,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> who brought me a
    lovely turquoise bracelet from Uncle Cambridge, and gave me a box with
    sandal-wood instruments in it; Augusta who gave me a small turquoise
    ring; and George who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>gave me an album with a drawing of his in it. At
    20 minutes to 5 we drove out with Lehzen and Charles. At 7 we dined,
    Lady Flora, Lady Conroy, Jane, Victoire, Messrs E. and H., and Sir J.
    Conroy dined here. After dinner came Aunt Sophia. Mdlle. David (sister
    to Mme. Dulcken) played on the piano. I stayed up till ½ past 9. My
    <em>dear</em> Mamma’s great present was that delicious concert which I
    shall <em>never forget</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 9th June.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 8 and got up soon after. At
    ½ past 9 we breakfasted with the King, the Queen, Charles, the Duchess
    of Northumberland, Lady Brownlow, Lady Catherine, and Lehzen. At ½ past
    10 we went with the whole party to Eton College to see Eton Montem.
    In the first carriage were the King, the Duke of Cumberland, the Duke
    of Cambridge, and George, who had all 3 just arrived; in the 2nd, the
    Queen, Mamma, I, and Charles; in the 3rd, the Duke and Duchess of
    Northumberland and Lady Brownlow; in the 4th Lord and Lady Denbigh; in
    the 5th Lady Sophia Cust, Lady De Lisle, Miss Eden, and Mr. Schiffner;
    in the 6th Lord and Lady Frederick Fitzclarence and their daughter; in
    the 7th Lehzen, Miss Hudson, and Miss Wilson. All the other gentlemen
    rode. This is as near as I can remember. We were received by the
    Provost<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> and Dr. Hawtrey.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
    We then went <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>into the yard under a
    sort of veranda and saw all the boys pass by which was a very pretty
    sight. Some of the costumes were very pretty. Some were dressed like
    Greeks, some like archers, others like Scotchmen, &amp;c. We then went into
    the Provost’s house, and from thence saw the boy wave the standard. We
    also saw the Library which is very curious and old. Eton College was
    founded by King Henry the Sixth. We then re-entered our carriages and
    drove to Salt Hill where we again saw the standard waved by the boy.
    We then drove home. The heat the whole time was <span class="smcap">tremendous</span>.
    We came home at ½ past 1. At 2 we lunched with the King, the Queen,
    the Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge, George, the Duke and Duchess
    of Northumberland, Lord and Lady Brownlow, Lady Denbigh, Lady De
    Lisle, Lady Sophia Cust, Lady Frederick Fitzclarence, Lord Howe, Lady
    Catherine, and Lehzen. At 4 we went out driving. The Queen, Mamma,
    I and Charles were in the first carriage; the Duke and Duchess of
    Northumberland and Lord and Lady Brownlow in the 2nd; Lord Denbigh and
    Miss Eden in the 3rd; and Lady Catherine and Lehzen in the 4th. We
    drove to the Virginia Waters. We went on the water there, and at a ¼ to
    6 re-entered the carriages and reached home at 7. We went on the steps
    before the Castle and saw all the boys and many other people walking on
    the terrace. They cheered the King and Queen <em>very loudly</em>, and me
    also. At 8 we dined. We went in to dinner in the same way as yesterday
    and the dinner-party was the same, only that Lord and Lady Frederick
    were not there. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>Dukes of Cumberland and Cambridge and George had
    left the Castle after luncheon. I stayed up till a ¼ past 10....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 14th July.</i>—At 11 came the Dean till 12. At 12 came Mr.
    Westall till 1. At 1 we lunched. The Duchess of Northumberland was
    present at the first lesson. At ½ past 2 I sat to Mr. Collen till ½
    past 3. At a ¼ to 4 came the Dean till a ¼ past 4. At 5 we went out
    with Lehzen and came home at 6. At a ¼ to 7 we dined. Lady Theresa
    dined here. At 8 we went to the opera with Lady Theresa and Lehzen. It
    was the <cite>dear Puritani</cite>. Grisi was in perfect voice and sang and
    acted beautifully; but I must say that she shows her many fatigues in
    her face, and she is certainly much thinner than when she arrived. It
    is a great pity too that she now wears her front hair so much lower
    than she did. It is no improvement to her appearance, though (do what
    she may) <em>spoil</em> her face she <em>never</em> can, it is too lovely
    for that. And besides, she forgot to change her dress when she came on
    to sing the Polacca. In general she comes on to sing that as a bride,
    attired in a white satin dress with a wreath of white roses round her
    head; instead of which she remained in her first dress (likewise very
    pretty) of blue satin with a little sort of handkerchief at the back
    of her head. Lablache, Tamburini and Rubini were also all 3 in high
    good voice. The exquisite quartet “A te o cara” and the lovely Polacca
    “Son vergin vezzosa” were both encored as was also the <em>splendid</em>
    duet “Il rival.” After the opera was over, Grisi, Rubini, Lablache,
    and Tamburini came out and were loudly applauded. The two last always
    make a separate bow to our box, which is very amusing to see. We
    came away immediately after the opera was over, for the ballet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>is
    not worth seeing since La Déesse de la Danse has flown back to Paris
    again. She appeared for the last time on Saturday the 4th of this
    month. We came home at 10 minutes to 12. I was <em>highly amused</em> and
    <em>pleased</em>! We came in while Tamburini was singing his song, which
    is just before the lovely duet between Grisi and Lablache....</p>

  </figure>

  <p><i>Monday, 20th July.</i>—I awoke at 7. Mamma told me this morning
    that she had received the melancholy news last night of the death of
    my dear Aunt Sophie, Countess Mensdorff,<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> who was here now nearly
    two years ago. It is so sudden and unexpected that we were <em>very much
    shocked</em>, <em>surprised</em> and <em>distressed</em> at the <em>sad</em>
    news. My poor dear Aunt had been for many years in very bad health,
    and when she visited us she was unable to walk alone almost; but as
    we had not heard that she was unwell even, it startled and shocked us
    very much. She went from Prague, already very unwell, in spite of Uncle
    Mensdorff’s efforts to prevent her, to visit her youngest son Arthur
    who was in his garrison in a wretched little village in Bohemia, and it
    was there, far from her relations (except Uncle Mensdorff and Arthur),
    without any of the comforts which she was accustomed to, in a poor sort
    of cottage, that she breathed her last! My poor dear Aunt, I feel this
    loss <em>very</em> deeply. The more so for having seen her here! At ½
    past 9 we breakfasted. At 10 we walked out with Lehzen till ½ past 10.
    The melancholy event happened on the 8th of this month! I feel the loss
    of my dear Aunt <em>very deeply</em>! Though I should be equally sad at
    losing her, had I <em>not</em> known her, because all Mamma’s relations
    are <em>dear</em> to me; but having <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>seen her, having lived with her
    in the same house for more than a week, having been in her room and
    seen her at her occupations, and having experienced her great kindness
    to me personally, makes it more striking still, and makes me feel the
    weight of the loss we have experienced more. At 1 we lunched. At 5 we
    drove out in the country with Lehzen till 7. At ½ past 7 we dined. I
    stayed up till a ¼ past 9. We passed a very sad evening....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 23rd July.</i>— ... Mamma received this afternoon a letter
    from Uncle Ernest enclosing the copy of one written by dear Uncle
    Mensdorff, giving all the sad details about my poor <em>dear</em> Aunt.
    I fear her sufferings must have been very severe at first and during
    her illness; but at the last she seems to have had no suffering, no
    struggle. Her last moment was so quiet that Uncle Mensdorff thought she
    slept, and when he rose at 4 o’clock in the morning, he was pleased
    to see her sleep so quietly and said to his servant that he hoped the
    danger was over. Alas! how different was it really! My Aunt’s maid went
    into the room and perceiving she did not breathe, called my Uncle in,
    who then saw the dreadful truth! She slept truly, but she slept never
    more to wake! What dear Uncle’s feelings were at that moment, and what
    they still are, may be well imagined! She has been placed temporarily
    in the vault of the convent of the Elisabetherin Nuns, at Kaden in
    Bohemia. The funeral was splendid. Thousands came from far and near and
    all her former friends followed her to her last abode, where she will
    suffer no more grief or pain! Two regiments with their bands playing
    the funereal music followed and all the Nuns with burning tapers. They
    strewed the coffin with flowers when it entered the convent, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>and
    ornamented the vault in the same manner. It is a happiness to know that
    she was so much beloved. My poor dear Aunt, I loved her <em>dearly</em>
    and feel the loss deeply. Time may weaken, but it can never never
    efface the recollection of this loss. I shall always try to do what I
    can to please, and to contribute to the happiness of <em>dear</em> Uncle
    Mensdorff and my four cousins. They say that a smile was imprinted on
    her countenance when she died, and that she looked more friendly after
    her death than she had done some time previous to it....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 30th July.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. I gave Mamma
    a little pin and drawing done by me in recollection of today. I gave
    Lehzen a ring, also in recollection of today. I forgot to say that
    Mamma gave me 3 little books yesterday, two of which I have quite read
    through and the third in part. They are <cite>A Method of Preparation for
    Confirmation</cite>, by William Hale Hale; <cite>An Address to the Candidates
    for Confirmation</cite>, by Dr. John Kaye, Bishop of Lincoln; and <cite>An
    Address to the Students of Eton College who are about to present
    themselves for Confirmation in 1833</cite>. They are all 3 very nice
    books. At a ¼ past 9 we breakfasted. I forgot to say that dear Lehzen
    gave me 4 very pretty prints of religious subjects. At ½ past 11 we
    went with Lady Flora, Lehzen, the Dean &amp;c. to St. James’s where I was
    to be confirmed. I felt that my confirmation was one of the most solemn
    and important events and acts in my life; and that I trusted that it
    might have a salutary effect on my mind. I felt deeply repentant for
    all what I had done which was wrong and trusted in God Almighty to
    strengthen my heart and mind; and to forsake all that is bad and follow
    all that is virtuous and right. I went with the firm <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>determination to
    become a true Christian, to try and comfort my dear Mamma in all her
    griefs, trials and anxieties, and to become a dutiful and affectionate
    daughter to her. Also to be obedient to <em>dear</em> Lehzen who has done
    so much for me. I was dressed in a white lace dress, with a white crape
    bonnet with a wreath of white roses round it. I went in the chariot
    with my dear Mamma and the others followed in another carriage. We
    went into the King’s Closet with Lady Flora and Lehzen, where we were
    received by the King and Queen. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge,
    Aunt Sophia, the Duke of Cumberland, the Duchess of Weimar,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> the
    Duchess of Northumberland, the Marquis of Conyngham, Earl Denbigh, Mr.
    Ashley, the Duke of Northumberland &amp;c., were also there. We then went
    with all into the Royal Pew in the Chapel. The usual morning service
    was performed; after which we all went down into the lower part of the
    Chapel. The King went first leading me, the Queen followed leading
    Mamma, and all the others followed after. I stood without the rail
    before the Altar, between the King and my dear Mamma. The Queen and all
    the rest went into pews on each side of the Altar. The Archbishop of
    Canterbury and Bishop of London<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> stood on either side of the Altar.
    I took off my bonnet. When the usual address had been read, I (as is
    usual for all to do) replied “I do,” and then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>knelt down and received
    the benediction from the Archbishop. The whole was performed by the
    Archbishop who read also a very fine address to me, composed by him
    expressly for the occasion. He did the whole very well, and I felt the
    whole <em>very deeply</em>. My dear Mamma was very much affected by the
    whole. We went away from the Altar in the same way as we came and then
    went into the Closet again; where the King gave me a very handsome set
    of emeralds, and the Queen a head-piece of the same kind. We then drove
    home. We came home at a ¼ to 2. I was very much affected indeed when
    we came home. My dear Mamma gave me a very lovely bracelet with her
    hair in it, and a very pretty set of turquoises. She gave dear Lehzen a
    very pretty bracelet. We received the joyful news this afternoon that
    my dearest sister Feodore had been safely confined on the 20th instant
    with a daughter<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> which is to be called Adelaide, Victoria, Mary,
    Louisa, Amelia, Constance. I hope to God that both Mother and Child
    will continue as well as they have hitherto been. At 6 we dined. At 7
    we drove out with Lehzen till ½ past 8. The heat continues intense! I
    stayed up till ½ past 9....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 2nd August.</i>—I awoke after 7 and got up at ½ past 8. At ½
    past 9 Lehzen and I breakfasted. At 11 we went to the Chapel with Lady
    Flora and Lehzen. The Dean performed the service; and the Archbishop of
    Canterbury preached a very fine sermon. The text was taken from the 5th
    chapter of the 2nd epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, 10th verse:
    “For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ; that every
    one may receive <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>the things done in his body, according to that he
    hath done, whether it be good or bad.” After the sermon was over we
    took the holy sacrament with Lady Flora, dear Lehzen, and Sir J. C.
    The Archbishop and the Dean administered it to us. It was the first
    time of taking it. It is a very solemn and impressive ceremony and when
    one recollects and thinks that we take it in remembrance of the death
    of our blessed Saviour, one <em>ought</em>, nay <em>must</em> feel deeply
    impressed with holy and pious feelings!...</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Tunbridge Wells</span>, <i>Wednesday, 19th August</i>.—Today is my
    <em>poor dear</em> Aunt Sophie’s birthday.... I read to Lehzen out of
    Sully’s Memoirs. It is wonderful when one considers how many years ago
    they have been written. Upwards of 300 years, and how modern and pure
    the style is! His account of the horrible massacre of St. Bartholomew
    is highly interesting as coming from the pen of an eye-witness! I then
    played on the piano with Mamma and by myself. At ½ past 12 we lunched.
    At 1 we went to the races with Lady Flora, Lehzen, and Sir G. Anson.
    It was very amusing. The day was beautiful and we sat under a sort of
    covering of cloth decorated with flowers, in our carriage. The Manor
    Stakes were won by a chesnut mare called Tirara belonging to a Mr.
    James Bacon. The Give-and-Take plate as it was entitled, was won by
    Mr. John Bacon’s chesnut mare Malibran, and the Kent and Sussex stakes
    was won by Mr. Pegg’s horse Little-thought-of. Amongst the numbers of
    beggars, itinerary musicians, actors etc. of all sorts and kinds, was a
    boy of 14 years old who called himself the son of an actor Williamson,
    very poorly dressed, who declaimed by heart a part of Marmion and of
    Campbell’s poems with great <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>feeling and talent. We came home at 5. At
    a ¼ past 7 we dined. When we came home I played on the piano and wrote
    my journal. Lady, the Misses, and M. S. Conroy, and Mr. Palmer dined
    here. After dinner came Mme. Dulcken. I stayed up till a ¼ past 9....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 23rd August.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past
    9 we breakfasted. After breakfast I wrote my journal and some extracts
    from the Peerage. At 11 we went with Lady Flora and Lehzen to church.
    Mr. Pope officiated and preached a sermon. The text was from the 6th
    chapter of St. Matthew, 10th verse: “Thy kingdom come.” It was not one
    of his best sermons and it was not according to my liking. He can and
    has preached some very fine sermons. At 1 we lunched. After luncheon
    I wrote extracts again. Lehzen then read to me out of the Sketch-book
    while I worked. At ½ past 4 we drove out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and
    came home at 6. I then wrote my journal. At a ¼ past 7 we dined. Sir
    George, Mr. and Miss Anson, Lady and the Misses and Mr. S. Conroy dined
    here. After dinner I took up Mrs. Butler’s Journal<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and read a
    little in it. It certainly is very pertly and oddly written. One would
    imagine by the style that the authoress must be very pert, and not well
    bred; for there are so many vulgar expressions in it. It is a great
    pity that a person endowed with so much talent as Mrs. Butler really
    is, should turn it to so little account and publish a book which is so
    full of trash and nonsense which can <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>only do her harm. I stayed up
    till 20 minutes past 9....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 25th August.</i>— ... At ½ past 2 sat to M. Collen for my
    picture till ½ past 3, while Lehzen read to me in Mme. de Sévigné’s
    Letters. How truly elegant and natural her style is! It is so full of
    naïveté, cleverness and grace. Then I played on the piano. At 4 we
    walked out with Lady Flora and Lehzen and came home at 5 minutes to 5.
    In our walk we met a man with beautiful parrots. Amongst them was one
    dear little paroquet of a green colour with a pale brown head and so
    very tame that Mamma took it on her finger and it would hardly leave
    her. It talks also, the man says. It is not so remarkable for its fine
    plumage than for its great tameness. Mamma bought the dear little
    thing. It is now in Mamma’s room....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 28th August.</i>—At ½ past 11 came the Dean till 1. I read
    first in the Old Testament, then in Clarendon, and finished with the
    <cite>Spectator</cite>. At 1 we lunched. I read after luncheon in the Bishop
    of Chester’s <cite>Exposition of the Gospel of St. Matthew.</cite> It is
    a very fine book indeed. Just the sort of one I like; which is just
    plain and comprehensible and full of truth and good feeling. It is not
    one of those learned books in which you have to cavil at almost every
    paragraph. Lehzen gave it me on the Sunday that I took the Sacrament.
    I have given up reading Smith’s <cite>Theology</cite>. It is more a book to
    refer to than to read all through....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 1st September.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7.
    At ½ past 8 we breakfasted. At ½ past 9 we left <em>dear</em> Tunbridge
    Wells with Lady Flora and Lehzen. I am <em>very</em> sorry to leave the
    dear place. I am so very fond of it. I liked Boyne <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>House better a good
    deal than old Mount Pleasant.... We changed horses first at Tunbridge
    Town, then at Sevenoaks, and lastly at Bromley. We reached Kensington
    Palace at 2. At a ¼ past 2 we lunched. Lady Flora went home after
    luncheon to her own family. At 3 we went over to Aunt Sophia’s (all our
    carpets being taken up), to receive the Duc de Nemours. Aunt Sophia of
    course was <em>not</em> present. The Duc de Nemours is nearly 21. That
    is to say His Royal Highness will complete his 21st year on the 25th
    of October. He is Aunt Louisa’s 2nd brother. He is tall, has a very
    fine slender figure, and is extremely fair. He is good-looking but not
    so much so as his brother the Duke of Orleans. The Duc de Nemours is
    extremely pleasing but rather timid. He brought Mamma a letter from his
    Mother, the Queen of the French, and a beautiful set of instruments
    made of French pebbles for me, from her. I wrote my journal then. We
    then saw Lady Catherine Jenkinson, and afterwards my Uncle Sussex. I
    then wrote my journal and did various other things. At a ¼ past 7 we
    dined. Lord Liverpool and Lady Catherine dined here. After dinner came
    Princess Sophia. I stayed up till ½ past 9....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 4th September.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at ½ past 7. At
    ½ past 8 we all breakfasted. At ½ past 9 we left Wansford. It is a
    very nice clean Inn. We passed through Stamford, a large and populous
    town, after having changed horses at Witham Common. We changed horses
    2ndly at Grantham, also a large town. These 3 are in Lincolnshire.
    3rdly at Newark, also a large town, and lastly at Scarthing Moor. The
    country from Wansford to Scarthing Moor was like yesterday, extremely
    flat and ugly. From Scarthing Moor to Barnby <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>Moor, where we arrived
    at 5 o’clock, the country is rich and wooded, but very flat. This Inn
    (Barnby Moor) is extremely clean and pretty. Newark, Scarthing Moor
    and Barnby Moor are all in Nottinghamshire. I am struck by the number
    of small villages in the counties which we passed through today, each
    with their church. And what is likewise peculiar is, that the churches
    have all steeples of a spiral shape. I read in the <cite>Alhambra</cite>
    again in the carriage. Finished the 1st vol. and began the 2nd. We all
    walked in the little garden behind the house for a short time. When
    we came in I wrote my journal. At a ¼ to 7 we all dined. After dinner
    Lady Catherine played on the piano, for there was one in the Inn. She
    played a variation of Herz’s, one of Hünten’s, and the Polacca; and she
    accompanied us while we sang “Il rival.” I stayed up till 9.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 5th September.</i>—I awoke at ½ past 6 and got up at 7.
    Read in the <cite>Exposition of St. Matt.’s Gospel</cite> while my hair was
    doing, and also in the Venetian History. Last night I also read in the
    Gospel and in Mme. de Sévigné. At a ¼ to 8 we all breakfasted. At a ¼
    to 9 we left Barnby Moor. It is a remarkably nice and clean Inn. We
    changed horses 1st at Doncaster, a very pretty town, 2ndly at Ferry
    bridge where there is a fine bridge, and lastly at Tadcaster. All these
    towns are in Yorkshire. We reached Bishopthorpe (the Archbishop of
    York’s Palace) at 2. It is 2 miles and a half from York. It is a very
    large house and part of it is very old. Besides the Archbishop<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
    and Miss <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>Harcourt (his daughter), the Duchess of Northumberland, Lady
    Norreys,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Sir John and Lady Johnstone<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> (Lady Johnstone is the
    Archbishop’s daughter), Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Granville Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
    Colonel Francis Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Mr. Vernon, are staying in the house.
    After half an hour we lunched in a large dining-room. We then went
    to our rooms which are very nice. I finished the <cite>Alhambra</cite>.
    It is a most entertaining book and has amused me very much. I wrote
    my journal when I came into my room. Wrote a letter to Feodore and
    read in the Venetian History. The country through which we travelled
    today is very flat and ugly, but extremely rich. I find the air in
    Yorkshire cooler than in Kent and the South of England. I read in Mrs.
    Butler’s journal which amuses me. There are some very fine feelings
    in it. At a ¼ to 7 we dined. Besides the people whom I mentioned,
    Mr. Charles Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Mr. William Harcourt, the Lord Mayor and
    Lady Mayoress, Colonel York, Colonel<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and Mrs. Wildman, &amp;c. After
    dinner Lady Norreys and her cousin Miss Vernon sang a duet from <cite>La
    Gazza Ladra</cite> beautifully, and also “Suoni la tromba.” They are both
    extremely pretty. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>They are pupils of Tamburini. We sang something
    then. I like Miss Vernon’s voice the best of the two. We then went
    to prayers. After that, I sang the Barcarola from <cite>Faliero</cite>,
    frightened to death. I stayed up till a ¼ to 11....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Bishopthorpe</span>, <i>Wednesday, 9th September</i>.—... At a ¼ past
    11 we went to the York Minster with the same party as yesterday with
    the exception of Lord and Lady Norreys and Mrs. Vernon, who remained
    at home. The Minster was fuller than on the preceding day. It was
    Handel’s Oratorio of <cite>The Messiah</cite>. It is considered very fine,
    but I must say that, with the exception of a few Choruses and one or
    two songs, it is very heavy and tiresome. It is in 3 parts. In the
    1st part Grisi sang “Rejoice greatly” <em>most beautifully</em>. She
    pronounces the English so <em>very well</em>, and sang the whole in such
    excellent style.... The Hallelujah Chorus at the end of the 2nd part
    and another at the end of the 3rd act are the finest things besides
    “Rejoice greatly.” But I am not at all fond of Handel’s music, I like
    the present Italian school such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti &amp;c.,
    <em>much better</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 11th September.</i>— ... Lablache and Rubini sang only
    once each. Alas! it will be a long time before I shall hear their two
    fine voices again. But time passes away quickly and April and the
    dear Opera will soon return. I am to learn to sing next year. Mamma
    promised I should; and I hope to learn of Lablache. What a delightful
    master he would be to learn of! Grisi sang “Laudate Dominum,” by
    Mozart, accompanied by Dr. Camidge<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>on the organ. She executed the
    delicate passages in it <em>beautifully</em>. Between the two parts we
    lunched at the Deanery with our party and many others. Grisi came in
    with her uncle while we were at luncheon. She is extremely handsome,
    near-by, by day-light. Her features are not small, but extremely fine,
    and her eyes are beautiful as are also her teeth. She has such a sweet
    amiable expression when she smiles, and has pleasing quiet manners. She
    had an ugly dingy foulard dress on, with a large coloured handkerchief
    under a large muslin collar. And she had a frightful little pink bonnet
    on, but in spite of all her ugly attire she looked very handsome. She
    is a most fascinating little creature.... Grisi sang the last air
    “Sing ye to the Lord.” Never did I hear anything so beautiful. It was
    a complete triumph! and was quite electrifying! Though a very little
    bit and with very little accompaniment, the manner, the power with
    which she sang it, and the emphasis which she put into it, was truly
    splendid. I shall just write down the lines:</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">Sing ye to the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously:</div>
        <div class="i0">The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">She pronounced it beautifully. When she had sung “The horse and his
    rider hath He thrown” she paused a moment, and then came out most
    emphatically with “<em>into the sea</em>!”...</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 12th September.</i>— ... At 11 we left Bishopthorpe, but
    not without regret. They are a very amiable family. Miss Harcourt is
    a very nice person. She ought by rights to be called Miss Georgiana
    Harcourt, the Archbishop’s eldest daughter being unmarried, but as she
    never goes out and does not make the <i>honneurs</i> in the house,
    Miss Georgiana <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>is always called Miss Harcourt.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The Archbishop
    has <em>10</em> sons, 5 of whom were at Bishopthorpe; 3 staying in the
    house, Mr. Granville Harcourt, Colonel Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and Mr. Egerton
    Harcourt, and two out of the house, Mr. William Harcourt<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> and Mr.
    Charles Harcourt,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> staying at the residence. Mrs. William Harcourt
    is a very nice person. We passed a pleasant time at Bishopthorpe in
    spite of fatigues which were <em>not slight</em> and which I begin to
    <em>feel</em>....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Canterbury</span>, <i>Thursday, 29th September</i>.—I awoke at 6
    and got up at ½ past 7. At ½ past 8 we all breakfasted. At ½ past 9
    Mamma received an address from the Mayor and Corporation here. We then
    saw some officers. After this we left Canterbury. It is a very clean
    nice Inn. It was a fine day. We reached Ramsgate at ½ past 12. The
    people received us in a most friendly and kind way. The whole was very
    well conducted, and the people were very orderly. The streets were
    ornamented with arches of flowers and flags. The open, free, boundless
    (to the eye) ocean looked very refreshing. There is nothing between us
    and France but the sea, here. We have got a small but very nice house,
    overlooking the sea. At a ¼ past 2 we walked down to the Albion Hotel
    to see the preparations made for dear Uncle Leopold and dear Aunt
    Louisa. At a little past 4 we went down to the Hotel with Lady Flora,
    Lehzen and Lady Conroy, as the steamer <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>was in sight. With beating
    hearts and longing eyes we sat at the window, anxiously watching the
    steamer’s progress. There was an immense concourse of people on the
    pier to see them arrive. After about half an hour’s time, the steamer
    entered the Harbour, amidst loud cheering and the salute of guns from
    the pier, with the Belgian flag on its mast. My <em>dearest</em> Uncle
    Leopold, King of the Belgians, and <em>dearest</em> Aunt Louisa were
    very warmly received. It was but the people’s duty to do so, as dear
    Uncle has lived for so long in England and was so much beloved. After
    another ¼ of an hour of anxious suspense, the waiter told us that
    “Their Majesties were coming.” We hastened downstairs to receive them.
    There was an immense crowd before the door. At length Uncle appeared,
    having Aunt Louisa at his arm. What a happiness was it for me to throw
    myself in the arms of that <em>dearest</em> of Uncles, who has always
    been to me like a father, and whom I love so <em>very dearly</em>! I had
    not seen him for 4 years and 2 months. I was also delighted to make the
    acquaintance of that dear Aunt who is such a perfection and who has
    been always so kind to me, without knowing me. We hastened upstairs,
    where Uncle Leopold and Aunt Louisa showed themselves at the window
    and were loudly cheered; as they ought to be. I do not find dear Uncle
    at all changed. On the contrary I think he looks better than he did
    when I last saw him. Aunt Louisa is not quite so tall as Mamma, and
    has a very pretty slight figure. Her hair is of a lovely fair colour;
    her nose is aquiline, her eyes are quite lovely; they are light blue
    and have such a charming expression. She has such a sweet mouth and
    smile too. She is delightful, and was so affectionate to me directly.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>She pronounces English extremely well and speaks it very fluently.
    She almost always speaks it with Uncle. She was very simply dressed
    in a light brown silk dress, with a sky-blue silk bonnet and white
    veil. Uncle and Aunt are accompanied by Comtesse Henri de Mérode (Dame
    d’Honneur to Aunt Louisa), and General Goblet.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> M. Van de Weyer is
    also here. We then left them and Lehzen and I drove home and Mamma and
    the rest walked home. At a little after 7 we dined. Dear Uncle Leopold,
    dear Aunt Louisa, the Duc de Nemours (who had only arrived half an hour
    ago), Comtesse H. de Mérode, General Goblet, General Baudrand,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> M.
    Van de Weyer, Dr. Clark,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Mr. and Miss V. Conroy, dined here. I sat
    between Uncle Leopold and the Duc de Nemours; two <em>delightful</em>
    neighbours. When I say <em>next</em> to a person, as for instance I said
    the other day, and many days, “I sat next to the Duc de Nemours,” “I
    sat next to the Duke of Norfolk,” &amp;c., &amp;c., I mean, as I did today,
    that I sat <em>between</em> or <em>next</em> to them at <em>dinner</em>. The
    Duc de Nemours, now that I see him and Aunt <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>Louisa together, is not
    like her. He has such a <em>good</em> kind expression in his face; and
    Aunt Louisa has the most <em>delightful sweet</em> expression I ever saw.
    She is quite delightful and charming. She is so gay and merry too. She
    had a white moiré dress on, and her fine hair was so well done, in a
    plait behind and curls in front with a row of pearls and three black
    velvet bows in it. After dinner came two other gentlemen of the Duc
    de Nemours, Colonel Boyer and Monsieur Larnac. We passed a <em>most
    delightful</em> evening....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 5th November.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. Dressed,
    walked over to my room and breakfasted at 9. Read in the Exposition
    of St. Matt.’s Gospel, and in the Venetian History while my hair
    was doing. <em>Dear good</em> Lehzen takes such care of me, and is
    so unceasing in her attentions to me, that I shall never be able
    to repay her sufficiently for it but by my love and gratitude. I
    never can sufficiently repay her for all she has <em>borne</em> and
    done for me. She is the <em>most affectionate, devoted, attached</em>,
    and <em>disinterested</em> friend I have, and I love her most
    <em>dearly</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 2nd December.</i>— ... We walked on the Pier which was
    very amusing. There are a number of foreign ships in the harbour;
    Portuguese, Finland, and a number of French fishing-boats. The dress
    of the French fishermen is very picturesque. There were some Spanish
    sailors playing on the pier, who looked very singular. Amongst others
    there was a little French fisher-boy playing with another boy with a
    pulley. He had a funny round rosy face, and was dressed in a loose blue
    woven woolen jacket, with huge boots which reached to his knees, and
    a red cap. Mamma asked him what he was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>doing, upon which he answered
    with naïveté, “Nous sommes à jouer un peu.” She asked him where he came
    from; “De Dunkirk,” was his reply. He said this all, and some other
    things, in such a funny naif way, and with such a sly arch smile, that
    it was quite amusing. He asked for a “sou,” and we gave him 6 pence,
    which pleased him very much....</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER V</h2>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> the Princess was seventeen the shadow of coming events was
      cast over her placid life. Her Journals contain evidence of
      this. She became aware that her Uncle, King Leopold, had begun
      to think with grave anticipation of the high position she might
      before long have to occupy, and of the project of uniting her in
      marriage to some Prince worthy to share with her the anxieties and
      responsibilities of a Throne. She knew that he had fixed upon her
      cousin, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg.</p>

    <p>In May of this year she saw the Prince for the first time. William
      IV. did not favour the views of King Leopold. His candidate was a
      younger son of the Prince of Orange. Both Princes were invited to
      London, and both were present at a ball given by the Duchess of
      Kent in honour of her daughter attaining the age of seventeen.</p>

    <p>The young Princess was not attracted by the Prince of Orange. It
      would be an exaggeration to say that she felt more than a sisterly
      affection for Prince Albert. She thought him good-looking and
      charming, and they sketched and sang together. He found her very
      amiable and astonishingly self-possessed. There is not a trace on
      either side of deeper sentiment. When the Prince left England, she
      wrote to her Uncle Leopold expressing anxiety to fall in with his
      wishes in respect of her future marriage as in everything else,
      but there is no indication that her heart was touched. The seed,
      however, was sown which was to ripen later, and ultimately to bear
      fruit, the sweetest she was destined to taste in her long life.</p>

    <p>The plans of King Leopold were an open secret, and roused
      considerable interest in all classes. On his return home Prince
      Albert was entertained in Paris at an official dinner given by Lord
      Granville, which was taken to mean that good progress had been made
      with the scheme of the projected marriage.</p>

    <p>In the course of this year the Princess resided at Claremont, then
      the property of King Leopold. Her life there was one of great
      simplicity. There were lately living a few old people in the
      village of Esher who remembered the little Princess attending the
      ancient church, now disused, dressed in spotted muslin with a large
      poke bonnet.</p>

    <p>Perhaps owing to the consciousness that his candidate had failed
      to create a favourable impression, King William during this year
      displayed more than usual hostility to his sister-in-law, the
      Duchess of Kent. The King’s behaviour to her mother undoubtedly
      saddened the life of the little Princess, more especially as it was
      in somewhat strong contrast to the kindness with which she herself
      was treated by King William and Queen Adelaide.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the stream of public events rolled smoothly along.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER V<br>1836</div>

  <p><i>Monday, 11th January.</i>— ... We went out walking at a ¼ to 2
    with Lady Flora and Lehzen; it had cleared up and was quite mild and
    bright. We walked on the pier and got into a boat. There was a good
    deal of swell in the Harbour, and at the mouth of it our boat pitched
    and rolled a good deal; Mamma began to look queerish, but I thought
    it very pleasant. There were numbers of people on the pier. The 3
    Portuguese vessels hoisted their Portuguese standards, as did also the
    two Spaniards. We landed at the same stairs where we embarked. The
    whole of Ramsgate seemed to be out on the pier. We walked to the head
    of the pier and back again and got into the carriage. We drove to the
    cliff where the stairs called “Jacob’s ladder” are. We got out there
    and went down the stairs, and walked on the other side of the pier. We
    took a parting look at the end of the pier, of all the ships, the pier
    &amp;c., for we go tomorrow. There were, I think, 7 French boats in the
    Harbour; and there were numbers of little French boys on the pier; we
    gave them something, but they (for the first time) proved dissatisfied
    and rebellious. They quite attacked Lehzen, who always gives the money,
    coming round her on all sides, stretching out their hands, saying
    “Donnez-moi un sou,” “Je n’ai pas un,” “Madame, Madame, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>donnez-moi un
    sou,” &amp;c. Some little urchins were <i>rusés</i> enough to say “C’est
    pour nos matelots, nous allons à bord dans l’instant.” Lehzen threw
    them a shilling, whereupon they all fell on the ground in one heap,
    scrambling after it. They were quiet for a little while, but a few
    little determined fellows came again and followed us for sometime. They
    at length got something, and went away. Cela était fort amusant et très
    ridicule à voir....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 13th January.</i>—I awoke at a little past 6 and got
    up at 7. Dressed and had my hair done. We breakfasted at 8. We left
    Sittingbourne at 9. It was a bitterly cold day, though bright and
    clear. We changed horses at Rochester, 2ndly at Gravesend, and 3rdly
    at Blackheath. We reached Kensington Palace at a little before 2. We
    instantly went upstairs, that is to say, up <em>two</em> staircases,
    to our new sleeping and sitting apartments which are very lofty and
    handsome. To describe them minutely and accurately would be impossible.
    Our bedroom<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> is very large and lofty, and is very nicely furnished,
    then comes a little room for the maid, and a dressing-room for Mamma;
    then comes the old gallery which is partitioned into 3 large, lofty,
    fine and cheerful rooms.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> One only of these (the one near Mamma’s
    dressing-room) is ready furnished; it is my sitting-room and is
    <em>very</em> prettily furnished indeed. My pictures are not yet in it.
    The next is my study, and the last is an anteroom; this last has no
    fireplace,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span> but the two others have, and my sitting-room is very warm
    and comfortable. There is another room, belonging to me, on another
    side of the bed-room (Lehzen’s former bed-room) which is not freshly
    furnished, but is a passage &amp;c. Lehzen is now in our former bed-room.
    When I went down into my poor former sitting-room,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> I could not
    help looking at it with affection, and pleasant recollections, having
    passed so many days of my life and many very pleasant ones there; but
    our new rooms are much more airy and roomy....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 14th January.</i>— ... Read out of Mme. de Sévigné while
    my hair was doing to Lehzen. We all breakfasted at a ¼ past 9. Carried
    things from my old room, upstairs to my new room, and put them into
    the new presses. Wrote my journal. My pictures are being hung up and
    my room is in a great confusion; the workmen in my study are making
    a great noise, so that I am <i lang="fr">un peu confuse</i>. Walked about. We
    lunched at 1. Arranged things. Saw Dr. Clark at 2. Received a most kind
    and long letter from dearest Aunt Louise in which she tells me that
    Uncle Leopold and my little cousin are well, as also Uncle Ferdinand,
    who is with them; and that the Duke of Orleans<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> (whom she calls
    <em>Chartres</em>, as the whole family generally do) is better but not
    quite well yet. She further adds, that the dear Queen of the French who
    had a very bad cold, is better....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 3rd February.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at a ¼ to
    8. Read in the Irish History while my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>hair was doing. At 9 we
    breakfasted. Pasted my name in some of my books. At 10 came the Dean
    till 11. Read with him first in the Old Testament and then in Hume.
    Pasted my name in some of my books. I have got all the same pictures I
    had in my former room, hung up in my present room, with the exception
    of some old prints and of the two ugly oil pictures of my Father and
    Mother, and with the addition of Hayter’s drawing of Mamma and I. My
    fine casts of the <em>dear</em> French family are also hung up in my
    sitting-room; they only came home today as the frame had to be mended.
    I am so fond of them. Various prints are also being hung up in my
    study. Wrote my journal. Drew....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 6th February.</i>— ... I have quite forgotten to mention
    that the young Queen of Portugal was married by proxy on the 1st of
    January to—<em>my Cousin Ferdinand</em>, Uncle Ferdinand’s eldest son,
    and who completed his 19th year on the 29th of last October.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
    negotiations to this purpose have been going on since last September,
    and have only just now come to an end. Count Lavradio, whom we saw just
    before we went to Ramsgate, went to Cobourg to meet Uncle Ferdinand and
    my dear Cousins Ferdinand and Augustus, there. Dear Uncle Leopold has
    managed a <em>great</em> deal of the business; he is ever ready and ever
    <em>most able</em> to assist his family. Uncle Ferdinand has not long
    left Brussels, where he came to settle and arrange about the marriage.
    Dear Uncle Ferdinand is, of course, full of anxiety for the welfare
    and happiness of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>his son. Ferdinand will soon come to Brussels with
    Augustus on his way to Lisbon and they will also come here. I cannot
    say how happy I am to become thus related to the Queen of Portugal, who
    has always been so kind to me and for whom I have always had a great
    affection. She is warm-hearted, honest and affectionate, and when she
    talks, is very pleasing. We have known each other since our 8th year
    (for there is only a month’s difference of age between us). She is far
    from plain too; she has an exquisite complexion, a good nose and fine
    hair. I hear that Ferdinand is full of good and excellent qualities,
    has a pure and unsophisticated mind, and is very good-looking....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 20th February.</i>— ... At ½ past 3 came the Dean
    till 4. Read with him in Milton’s <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>. Practised
    on the piano for Mrs. Anderson.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Drew while Lehzen read to
    me out of that Rapport about Fieschi.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> Practised again on
    the piano. At ½ past 7 we dined. Aunt Gloucester, the Prince of
    Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeldt,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> the Archbishop of York and Miss
    Harcourt, the Duke of Wellington, Count<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and Countess Charles
    Pozzo di Borgo, the Earl and Countess of Lincoln,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Viscount <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>and
    Viscountess Beresford,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Lord Hill, Lady Caroline Legge,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Lady
    Theresa Strangways, Sir Robert and Lady Peel, General Upton and Sir
    Samuel Higgins dined here. I sat between the Duke of Wellington and
    Count C. Pozzo di Borgo. The Count is a very agreeable man. His wife,
    the dear little Countess, looked lovely; she is such a charming person;
    she is the 3rd daughter of the Duc de Crillon and is called Valentina.
    Lady Lincoln is also a very charming young person; she was so pretty
    but she is very much changed as she was very ill all last summer and
    is still very far from well. I sat a good deal with her and the little
    Countess Pozzo, and found them very amiable and cheerful....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 27th February.</i>— ... It was Miss Joanna Baillie’s<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
    Tragedy of <cite>The Separation</cite> in 5 acts, performed for the 2nd
    time. The principal characters are: Garcio (an Italian Count), Mr.
    Charles Kemble,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> who acted finely in parts but is dreadfully
    changed; Rovani (his friend), G. Bennett <span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>who acted disagreeably and
    affectedly; the Marquis of Tortona, Mr. Pritchard, a poor odd-looking
    creature; Margaret (wife to Garcio), Miss Helen Faucit,<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> who acted
    well in the pathetic quiet parts. I had not seen Charles Kemble since
    5 years, and I did not quite recollect his countenance; those however
    who had seen him in his good days, when he was an excellent actor and
    a very handsome man, found the change <em>very great</em>. <em>I</em>, for
    <em>my</em> part, like Macready by far better. Kemble whines so much and
    drawls the words in such a slow peculiar manner; his actions too (to
    me) are overdone and affected, and his voice is not pleasant to me; he
    makes terrible faces also which spoils his countenance and he looks
    old and does not carry himself well. He was very fine, however, at
    the end of the 3rd act when he snatches the picture out of his wife’s
    hand, and when he discovers it to be that of her brother Ulrico whom
    he murdered,—the way in which he throws the picture on the ground and
    sinks trembling and gasping against the bed, while his countenance
    pourtrays the violent feelings of remorse, horror and conscience
    this Kemble did <em>very finely</em>, and also when he takes leave of
    Margaret. He <em>was</em> undoubtedly a very fine actor, nay, still
    <em>is</em>, but he is not natural enough for my taste. I <em>do</em>
    think Macready is so feeling and natural, particularly now; he was
    perhaps formerly rather affected and violent at times. His voice too
    I like so much and he does not drawl the words; I like him best after
    Young, who <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>was the <em>most beautiful</em> actor I ever saw, or who
    perhaps ever existed in this country, except Garrick and John Kemble
    (Charles K.’s elder brother). I only saw Young twice but I shall never
    forget it. I saw him 1st in <cite>Macbeth</cite> and then I saw him take
    his final leave of the stage in <cite>Hamlet</cite>. I must say a few words
    about G. Bennett<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and Miss Helen Faucit. Bennett, whom I have
    seen act really extremely well in <cite>The Miller and His Men</cite>, in
    <cite>Pizarro</cite>, in <cite>King John</cite> as Hubert, &amp;c., &amp;c., was extremely
    disagreeable yesterday as Rovani; he twisted his arms, hands, legs,
    back and even eyes in all directions, and drawled his words in speaking
    most disagreeably. Miss Faucit is plain and thin, and her voice is
    much against her, but when she is gentle and pathetic she is far from
    disagreeable; she rants and screams<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> too much also, but as she is
    very young, they say she may <em>become</em> a good actress. The Tragedy
    though well written is rather unnatural and very heavy in parts; I must
    say <em>I</em> greatly prefer <cite>The Provost of Bruges</cite> and think it
    by far more natural. Kemble and Miss Faucit were called out and were
    much applauded....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 29th February.</i>— ... At ½ past 7 we went to the play to
    Mme. Vestris’s<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Olympic, with Lehzen and Sir J. C. I had never been
    there before; it is a very small but pretty, clean little theatre.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>It was the burletta of <cite>One Hour</cite> or <cite>The Carnival Ball</cite>
    in one act. The principal characters are: Mr. Charles Swiftly, Mr.
    Charles Mathews,<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> a most <em>delightful</em> and <em>charming</em>
    actor; he is son to the celebrated old Mathews who died last year.
    He is quite a young man, I should say not more than five or six
    and twenty.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> His face is not good-looking, but very clever and
    pleasing; he has a very slight, pretty figure, with very small feet
    and is very graceful and immensely active; he skips and runs about the
    stage in a most agile manner. He is <em>so</em> natural and amusing,
    and never vulgar but always very gentlemanlike. He is a most charming
    actor....</p>

  <p>Charles Mathews is the most delightful and amusing actor possible. He
    is the only child of his parents and was intended for an architect and
    studied in Greece and Italy for that purpose; but having a penchant for
    the stage, he abandoned his profession and had become an actor; we see
    how it has succeeded—<em>most perfectly</em>!...</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 2nd March.</i>— ... Lady Burghersh<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> told me that she
    knew Charles Mathews very well when she was in Florence, where he was
    come for the purpose of studying architecture; she said she had often
    acted with him in their private theatricals and that he always showed
    a great talent for acting, and that he then performed as a gentleman;
    he <em>now</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>acts quite like a gentleman, and looks so too; he is
    a charming performer I think. Lady Burghersh also said that he looks
    younger than he is, for that he must be 3 or 4 and thirty. He told her
    when at Florence that he had a great passion for the stage, but, as his
    father was greatly averse to his son becoming an actor, he refrained
    from doing it during his father’s lifetime....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 17th March.</i>— ... We reached Windsor Castle at 6. We
    went to the Queen’s room where Ferdinand and Augustus were presented
    to the King. We then went to our rooms. At ½ past 7 we dined in St.
    George’s Hall with an immense number of people. Ferdinand looked very
    well. He wore the 3 Portuguese Orders in one ribbon, which he has the
    right of doing as husband to the Queen of Portugal. Ferdinand led the
    Queen in to dinner and the King led Mamma and I. I sat between the
    King and George Cambridge and opposite dear Ferdinand. After dinner we
    went into a beautiful new drawing-room<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> where we remained till the
    gentlemen came from dinner. We then all went into the Waterloo Gallery
    where the ball was. The King went in first, then the Queen and Mamma,
    and then dear Ferdinand with me at his arm. I danced 3 quadrilles;
    1st with dear Ferdinand, then with George Cambridge, and lastly with
    dear Augustus. During the evening dear Ferdinand came and sat near me
    and talked so dearly and so sensibly. I do <em>so</em> love him. Dear
    Augustus also sat near me and talked with me and he is also a dear good
    young man, and is very handsome. He is extremely quiet and silent, but
    there is a great deal in him. I am so fond too of my Uncle Ferdinand.
    I stayed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>up till 1. I was much amused and pleased. Uncle Ferdinand
    brought me two kind notes from Uncle Leopold and Aunt Louise. Ferdinand
    is so fond of Aunt Louise. He told me: “Oh, je l’aime tant!” Both he
    and Augustus speak French extremely well. This dinner and ball were in
    honour of dear Ferdinand.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 18th March.</i>— ... At ½ past 9 we breakfasted with
    the King, the Queen, dear Ferdinand (who came nearly at the end of
    the breakfast, having slept a long while), dear Uncle Ferdinand,
    Augustus, Charles, Prince Ernst of Hesse P.B.,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> the Duchess of
    Northumberland, George Cambridge, Lady Ely,<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Lady Flora, and
    Lehzen. After breakfast Mamma and I went into the Queen’s room and
    looked at some of her many pretty things. Wrote my journal. At ½ past
    11 we drove out with the Queen and dear Ferdinand in our carriage,
    Ferdinand and I sitting on the back seat and the Queen and Mamma on the
    front seat. Uncle Ferdinand, Augustus, Charles and Prince Ernest of
    Hesse P.B. followed in another, and all the rest in other carriages.
    We went to see a hunt and saw a stag let out of a cart and all the
    horsemen followed in great numbers. It was a very pretty sight, and
    a beautiful warm day. We were all in open carriages. I talked a good
    deal with Ferdinand, and like him <em>more</em> and <em>more</em>; he is
    so sensible, so natural, so unaffected, and unsophisticated and so
    <em>truly</em> good. His tutor, who has been with him 13 years, M. Dietz,
    and whom he told me he is very fond of, will go with him to Lisbon
    as his “secrétaire intime,” he told me. He (M. Dietz)<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> came with
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>several other gentlemen to Kensington yesterday. Ferdinand is so fond
    of Augustus; the separation will be dreadful for the two brothers; and
    he is very fond of his sister Victoire. We came home at ½ past 1. Wrote
    the <i>brouillon</i> of a French letter to Aunt Louise. At 2 we lunched
    with the whole party. I sat between the King and Uncle Ferdinand. Wrote
    my letter to Aunt Louise. Wrote my journal. Walked about. At about ½
    past 5 dear Ferdinand, Uncle Ferdinand, and dear Augustus came into our
    room for a little while. At ½ past 7 we dined; again in St. George’s
    Hall and with the same large company as the day before. Ferdinand went
    first (as he did also yesterday) with the Queen; then came the King
    with us two. I sat between the King and George Cambridge, and opposite
    dear Fernando. After dinner Uncle Ferdinand and my Cousins came and
    sat near us every now and then. Dear Ferdinand has elicited universal
    admiration from all parties; the King is very much pleased with him,
    and the Queen is quite taken with him. He is so very unaffected, and
    has such a distinguished appearance and carriage. They are both very
    dear and charming young men; Augustus is very amiable too, and when
    known, shows much good sense; he is very quiet and gentle. There is
    such an innocence and simplicity in them, and such a childish gaiety,
    and again they are very grown-up and nice in their manners, which are
    very unaffected and pleasing. Stayed up till ½ past 11....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 1st April.</i>—Today is Good Friday. At ½ past 9 we
    breakfasted with dear Uncle Ferdinand, dear Augustus, Charles, Lady
    Flora and Lehzen. I sat between dear Augustus and Charles. I stayed
    downstairs till a ¼ past 10. Received the Order <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>of Ste. Isabelle from
    my Cousin Donna Maria. The ribbon is very pale pink and white. Went
    up stairs, and wrote part of the <i>brouillon</i> of a French letter
    to Aunt Louise. Dear good Augustus came up at ½ past 10 and stayed
    till 11. These visits please me very much; he is <em>so</em> quiet, and
    goes about looking at the things in the room, sits down and reads
    the newspapers, and never is in the way. He is a dear boy, and is so
    extremely good, kind and gentle; he has such a sweet expression and
    kind smile. I think Ferdinand handsomer than Augustus, his eyes are so
    beautiful, and he has such a lively, clever expression; <em>both</em>
    have such a sweet expression; Ferdinand has something <em>quite
    beautiful</em> in his expression when he speaks and smiles and he is
    <em>so</em> good. They are both very handsome and <em>very dear</em>!
    Ferdinand is superior to Augustus in various ways, and is by far more
    forward for his age in his mind than the latter. They have both learnt,
    and know, a great deal, and are both very orderly and tidy. At 11 we
    went down to prayers with Charles, Lehzen, Lady Flora &amp;c. &amp;c. The
    service was performed by the poor Dean who gave us likewise a sermon.
    We saw him for an instant after the service was over. He is very
    calm and resigned. We remained with Uncle a little while downstairs.
    Finished my <i>brouillon</i> of my French letter. Began to copy it.
    Went downstairs to see some paintings done by a Mr. Cowen.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> They
    are very well done indeed. Augustus came in also and looked at them for
    a moment. Came up to my room and went on writing my letter to dear Aunt
    Louise. Dearest Uncle Ferdinand came up to me for a few minutes and
    then went down again. Augustus came up and stayed a little while, while
    I was writing my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>letter and then went down. I gave him this morning a
    seal and some prints which pleased him very much. Finished my letter
    to Aunt Louise and wrote my journal. At 25 minutes to 4 <em>dear</em>
    good Augustus came up and sat in my room looking at annuals till 4.
    He assisted me in sealing my letters, and we both made a mess, and
    he burnt a cover in sealing it, dear boy, for me, which made us both
    laugh. He went down for 5 minutes, came up again, and Uncle, after
    staying a few minutes, fetched him away to pay visits to the Duke of
    Sussex and Princess Sophia. Played and sung. At 10 minutes to 6 came
    Mrs. Wellesley<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> who is going tomorrow and will reach Stuttgardt on
    Friday. Augustus came in and we stayed with Uncle and him a few minutes
    downstairs. Oh! could I but have some more such days, with that dear
    Uncle and dear Augustus, whom I love so much! I shall feel very lonely
    and unhappy when they leave us....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 10th April.</i>— ... Read to Lehzen part of <cite>The
    Directions and Advices</cite> which dearest Uncle Leopold has written
    down for Ferdinand, most cleverly and beautifully done. They are
    written in French and are divided into 3 parts. The part I have read
    is <cite>Affaires Politiques</cite>, which is divided into headings of all
    the departments of the Government. Dear Uncle has studied<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> the
    Portuguese Constitution, Government, People, Country, &amp;c., &amp;c., so
    completely since the intended marriage of Ferdinand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> with the Queen
    of Portugal, that he is as familiar with the whole as though he were
    in the country. Dear Uncle Leopold is so clever and so prudent and so
    kind; he has taken so much pains and trouble about Ferdinand and I
    must say he is repaid for his trouble by the affection and gratitude
    Ferdinand has for him; and certainly he has <em>not</em> thrown away
    his time in so doing, for Ferdinand is not only <em>very good</em>, but
    <em>clever</em>, and therefore with Uncle’s advice he will succeed, I am
    sure. Van de Weyer is a most trusty, clever person, and as he has also
    copies of these papers, will be of the greatest use to Ferdinand. I
    see by the part I have read, which contains most valuable, important
    and sage advice, one thing which I am very glad of, which is, that the
    Queen will associate Ferdinand with her in the Council, &amp;c., that he is
    always to be present at all her Councils. Uncle advises him to listen
    and not to give his opinion until he has become acquainted with the
    characters of the persons in the Council, and then, after having well
    weighed what he means to say, to give his opinion. There is so much of
    all the advice which I wish I could insert here, but which I have no
    time to do.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 11th April.</i>—Lehzen read to me while I was dressing and I
    read to her while my hair was doing, one of the parts of the Directions
    for Ferdinand, called <cite>Observations Générales</cite>, and began the last
    one called <cite>Note communiquée au Comte de Lavradio</cite>. Dear Uncle
    Leopold is so clever and governs Belgium so beautifully, that he is a
    model for every <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>Sovereign and will contribute to the happiness and
    re-organisation of Portugal, as he has done to Belgium; for <em>that</em>
    country owes <em>all</em> its prosperity, happiness, everything, to
    dearest Uncle Leopold; it was in a sad state when Uncle arrived, and by
    his great prudence, sagacity, and extreme cleverness, Belgium is now
    one of the most flourishing Kingdoms in Europe....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 3rd May.</i>— ... At 10 minutes past 11 came
    <em>Lablache</em> till 10 minutes past 12. He complained much of the cold
    weather, and said “qu’ils étaient tous enrhumés” and that they had
    all been very hoarse last night at a concert, except Rubini. I like
    Lablache very much, he is such a nice, good-natured, good-humoured
    man, and a very patient and excellent master; he is so merry too.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>
    <i>En profile</i> he has a very fine countenance, I think, an aquiline
    nose, dark arched eye-brows, and fine long eyelashes, and a very
    clever expression. He has a profusion of hair, which is very grey,
    and strangely mixed with some few black locks here and there. I sung
    first the recitative of “Notte d’orrore,” from <cite>Marino Faliero</cite>,
    several times over. Then Mamma and I sung “Mira oh! Norma” and “Si fine
    al ore,” both twice over and “Qual cor tradesti” twice over. Then I
    sang twice with Lablache “Io son ricco e tu sei bella,” a very pretty
    little duo from <cite>L’Elisire d’Amore</cite> by Donizetti. He sang this
    delightfully, he has such a fine voice and pronounces so distinctly
    and so well. <i>En conclusion</i> I sang “Vivi tu.” I liked my lesson
    extremely; I only wish I had one every <em>day</em> instead of one every
    <em>week</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 13th May.</i>— ... Mme. Malibran de <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>Bériot<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> (as she
    now calls herself since her marriage with the eminent violinist de
    Bériot) was in very fine voice and sang extremely well indeed, twice.
    She sang first the prayer which Anna sings in her sleep in the 2nd
    act of <cite>La Sonnambula</cite>, and “Ah! non giunge unam pensiero!” I
    prefer Grisi’s singing of these very much to Malibran’s; there is a
    sweetness, mildness and softness, accompanied with such beautifully
    clear execution, in the <em>former</em>, which the <em>latter</em> does
    <em>not</em> possess in the high notes. Malibran’s deep tones are
    beautiful, touching and feeling, but her high notes are harsh, sharp
    and <i>voilée</i>. The 2nd thing she sang was pretty and well adapted
    to her voice....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 18th May.</i>— ... At a ¼ to 2 we went down into the
    Hall, to receive my Uncle Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and my
    Cousins, Ernest and Albert, his sons. My Uncle was here, now 5 years
    ago, and is looking extremely well. Ernest is as tall as Ferdinand and
    Augustus; he has dark hair, and fine dark eyes and eyebrows, but the
    nose and mouth are not good; he has a most kind, honest and intelligent
    expression in his countenance, and has a very good figure. Albert, who
    is just as tall as Ernest but stouter, is extremely handsome; his hair
    is about the same colour as mine; his eyes are large and blue, and he
    has a beautiful nose and a very sweet mouth with fine teeth; but the
    charm of his countenance is his expression, which is most delightful;
    <i>c’est à la fois</i> full of goodness and sweetness, and very clever
    and intelligent. We went upstairs with them, and after staying a few
    minutes with them, I went up to my room. Played and sang. Drew. At a
    little after 4 Uncle Ernest and my Cousins came up to us and stayed in
    my room till <span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>10 minutes past 5. Both my Cousins are so kind and good;
    they are much more <i>formés</i> and men of the world than Augustus;
    they speak English very well, and I speak it with them. Ernest will
    be 18 years old on the 21st of June and Albert 17 on the 26th of
    August. Dear Uncle Ernest made me the present of a most delightful
    <em>Lory</em>, which is so tame that it remains on your hand, and you may
    put your finger into its beak, or do anything with it, without its ever
    attempting to bite. It is larger than Mamma’s grey Parrot, and has a
    most beautiful plumage; it is scarlet, blue, brown, yellow, and purple.
    At 6 we went with Lehzen, Lady Flora &amp;c., to dine at the Archbishop of
    York’s, and I was very sorry to leave my dear Uncle and Cousins behind
    us at home....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 19th May.</i>—Read in the <cite>Exposition</cite> while my hair
    was doing. At 9 we breakfasted with Uncle Ernest, Ernest, Albert,
    Lehzen and Charles. I sat between my dear Cousins. At ½ past 10 Lehzen
    and I walked in the gardens and came home at ½ past 11. At a ¼ to 12
    came the Dean till ½ past 12. Read with him in the New Testament and
    in Clarendon. At ½ past 12 came Mr. Steward till ½ past 1. Played and
    sung. At a ¼ past 2 came the Dean till 3. Read with him in Paley. At 3
    came Mrs. Anderson till 4. At a ¼ to 5 we walked in the gardens with
    Lehzen till ½ past 5. Wrote my journal. At 7 we dined. Besides us 3 and
    Uncle, my Cousins and Charles,—Count Kolowrat (one of Uncle Ernest’s
    gentlemen), Lady Flora and the Miss Conroys &amp;c., dined here. I sat
    between dear Ernest and dear Albert. After dinner came Aunt Sophia.
    Received a very kind letter from dear Aunt Louise and some ribbons.
    Stayed up till ½ past 10. I like my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>Cousins extremely, they are so
    kind, so good, and so merry....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 21st May.</i>— ... At ½ past 7 we dined with Uncle Ernest,
    Ernest, Albert, Charles, Lady Flora, Count Kolowrat, Baron Alvensleben,
    &amp;c. I sat between my dear Cousins. After dinner came Princess Sophia.
    Baron de Hoggier, who had arrived from Lisbon the day before, came
    after dinner, and took leave, on his way home. I sat between my dear
    Cousins on the sofa and we looked at drawings. They both draw very
    well, particularly Albert, and are both exceedingly fond of music;
    they play very nicely on the piano. The more I see them the more I am
    delighted with them, and the more I love them. They are so natural, so
    kind, so <em>very</em> good and so well instructed and informed; they are
    so well bred, so truly merry and quite like children and yet very grown
    up in their manners and conversation. It is delightful to be with them;
    they are so fond of being occupied too; they are quite an example for
    any young person....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 22nd May.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. Read in
    <cite>Cornwallis on the Sacrament</cite> while my hair was doing. At a ¼ past
    9 we all breakfasted. I sat between <i>i miei carissimi cugini</i>. At
    a ¼ past 10 dear Lehzen and I walked out in the gardens and came home
    at a ¼ to 11. Received the news of the death of my poor old Nurse,
    Mrs. Brock, which took place the day before yesterday. She was not a
    pleasant person, and undoubtedly had, as everybody has, her faults, but
    she was extremely attached to and fond of me, having been with me from
    my birth till my fifth year, therefore it is impossible, and it would
    be very wrong, if I did not feel her death. My chief regret is, that
    she did <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>not live till I was my own mistress, and could make her quite
    comfortable....<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 24th May.</i>—I awoke at 7. Today I complete my 17th
    year; a very old person I am indeed! I am most thankful that I was
    brought through this year safely, and I beseech my heavenly Father to
    extend His benediction and blessing over me for this year and for many
    others....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 10th June.</i>—At 9 we all breakfasted for the <em>last</em>
    time together! It was our last <span class="smcap">happy happy</span> breakfast, with
    this dear Uncle and those <em>dearest</em>, beloved Cousins, whom I
    <em>do</em> love so <span class="smcap">very very</span> dearly; <em>much more dearly</em>
    than any other Cousins in the <em>world</em>. Dearly as I love Ferdinand,
    and also good Augustus, I love Ernest and Albert <em>more</em> than
    them, oh yes, <span class="smcap">much</span> <em>more</em>. Augustus was like a good,
    affectionate child, quite unacquainted with the world, phlegmatic,
    and talking but very little; but dearest Ernest and dearest Albert
    are so grown-up in their manners, so gentle, so kind, so amiable, so
    agreeable, so very sensible and reasonable, and so <em>really</em> and
    truly good and kind-hearted. They have both learnt a good deal, and are
    very clever, naturally clever, particularly Albert, who is the most
    reflecting of the two, and they like very much talking about serious
    and instructive things and yet are so <em>very very</em> merry and gay
    and happy, like young people ought to be; Albert used always to have
    some fun and some clever witty answer at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>breakfast and everywhere; he
    used to play and fondle Dash so funnily too. Both he and Ernest are
    extremely attentive to <em>whatever</em> they hear and see, and take
    interest in everything they see. They were much interested with the
    sight of St. Paul’s yesterday. We remained down with them till 10. I
    then went up to my room and came down again at a little after 10. We
    remained with them again, Uncle Ernest going in and out of the room. I
    am so very fond of <em>him</em> too; now that I know him much better and
    have talked with him, I love him as much as dear Uncle Ferdinand. He is
    so mild, so kind and so good. Dearest Albert was playing on the piano
    when I came down. At 11 dear Uncle, my <em>dearest beloved</em> Cousins,
    and Charles, left us, accompanied by Count Kolowrat. I embraced both my
    dearest Cousins most warmly, as also my dear Uncle. I cried bitterly,
    very bitterly....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 31st July.</i>—Read in <cite>The Young Divine</cite> and began
    to read in <cite>Ikon Basilike</cite> in one vol., a book which came out a
    few days after poor Charles I. had been beheaded; while my hair was
    doing. It is said to have been written by him during his captivity, and
    contains meditations and prayers; but the Dean, who gave it me a few
    days ago, told me that great disputes have arisen as to whether it was
    really written by Charles, or whether some friend of his had collected
    sayings and meditations he might have heard the King make, and put them
    together and that this point has not been settled yet. Whatever it may
    be, and by whomever it may have been written or compiled, one thing is
    certain, that it is a very good and pious book and is authentic as to
    its contents....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 3rd August.</i>—Read in the <cite>Exposition</cite> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>and
    in <cite>The Conquest of Granada</cite> while my hair was doing. At 9 we
    breakfasted. At a ¼ to 10 we went to the British Gallery with Lehzen
    to see the Exhibition by the ancient Masters (all private property).
    Never did I see anything more beautiful than this collection of the
    <em>immortal Masters’</em> paintings, for so I must call them as their
    names will never pass away. There were such numbers of beautiful
    paintings, that I really know not which to name in preference. Upon
    the whole, I think the finest were those by Murillo and Guido. The
    finest by Murillo are “The Angels coming to Abraham,” “The return of
    the Prodigal Son,” splendid both, belonging to the Duke of Sutherland.
    “St. Joseph leading the infant Saviour who carries a basket of
    carpenter’s tools,” quite in another style but beautiful; “Santa Rosa,
    espousing the infant Saviour,” exquisite; and “Portrait of Don Andres
    de Antrade and his favourite dog,” very fine. The finest by Guido are,
    “The Assumption of the Virgin,” the expression of the Virgin’s face
    is beautiful; two different heads of St. Peter, both very fine. “The
    Magdalen,” beautiful. The finest by Vandyke are “The Virgin and Infant
    Saviour,” very lovely.... At a ¼ to 4 we went with Lehzen and Lady
    Flora to Chiswick, to the Victoria Asylum or Children’s Friend Society.
    It is a most interesting and delightful establishment, and has been
    founded almost entirely by Lady George<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> and Miss Murray. It is for
    poor vagrant girls, who are received under the age of 15; and Miss
    Murray says that they have never had a girl 6 months who did not become
    a perfectly good child. I forget how young they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>receive children,
    but there are—[unintelligible] girls in all, and they are divided, a
    few being in an infant school upstairs. When they have become quite
    good and can read, write and do work of all kinds necessary for a
    house, they are sent abroad, mostly to the Cape of Good Hope, where
    they are apprenticed and become excellent servants. Miss Murray told
    us many curious stories of the depraved and wretched state in which
    many arrive, and how soon they become reformed and good. There is one
    little girl in particular, a very pretty black-eyed girl, 11 years old,
    called Ellen Ford, who was received two months ago from <em>Newgate</em>,
    and who boasted she could steal and tell lies better than anybody. She
    had been but two or three days in the school, and she got over 3 high
    walls, and stole a sheet; she was caught and brought back again. Miss
    Murray spoke to her, and found that the poor girl had no idea whatever
    of a <em>God</em>, and had a drunken father, a low Irishman; this man had
    lost his 1st wife and married again, and this step-mother taught the
    girl nothing but stealing and lying. Miss Murray told her of God, and
    spoke to her very seriously; the girl was put in solitary confinement
    for that night and was taken out the next morning; and ever since she
    has been a perfectly good girl. There are many cases of the same sort
    which Miss Murray said she could relate. Before I finish this chapter
    I must mention the Matron, a most respectable excellent person, called
    Mrs. Bowerhill; she is assisted by her two daughters, and by an old
    woman for work; but besides this old woman, the children do all the
    work themselves. We came home at ½ p. 6. I was very much pleased indeed
    with all I saw. Miss Murray gave me a book into which she had copied
    several of the letters of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>children from abroad, and very nice
    well-written letters they are. Miss Murray’s exertions are immense
    and most praiseworthy for the Children’s Friend Society. There is a
    Committee of Ladies who meet every other Tuesday I believe; but Lady
    George and Miss Murray go down 3 times a week and oftener. At a ¼ p. 7
    we dined. After dinner came Princess Sophia. Stayed up till 10 minutes
    to 10....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 8th August.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 8. At a ¼ past 9
    we breakfasted. At a ¼ to 10 Lehzen and I walked out till ½ past 10.
    Arranged things for packing. At 11 came my good Lablache and stayed
    till 20 minutes past 12. I sang 1st “Come per me sereno,” from <cite>La
    Sonnambula</cite>. Then he sang with me “Claudio, Claudio, ritorna fra
    le braccia paterne,” twice over; then he sang with me “Se un istante
    all’ offerta d’un soglio,” also from <cite>Elisa e Claudio</cite>. The former
    of these two was the one that I sang so very ill on Saturday, but
    which Lablache did not mind at all. <em>He</em> thought it went better
    today; but he is too indulgent. <em>He</em> was in delightful voice,
    and sang <em>beautifully</em>. After this he sang “Non temer il mio bel
    cadetto” from <cite>Il Posto abbandonato</cite>, by Mercadante, with me.
    His volubility of tongue is wonderful; he can sing such quantities
    of words and at such a rate. There are plenty in this Duo, and still
    more in “Quand amore,” and in “Voglio dire,” both from <cite>L’Elisire
    d’Amore</cite>. Then he sang my favourite “O amato zio” from my dear
    <cite>Puritani</cite>, with me. After this he sang “O nume benefico” with us;
    then “Ridiamo, cantiamo,” and then, <i>alas! per finire</i>, “Dopo due
    lustri ahi! misero,” from <cite>Donna Caritea</cite>, by Mercadante. Lablache
    told me that he likes <cite>Guillaume <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>Tell</cite> the best of <em>all</em>
    Rossini’s operas, <cite>Otello</cite> the best of his Operas Seria, and
    <cite>Il Barbiere</cite> the best of his buffa operas. <em>Ha ragione.</em>
    His son (Lablache’s) is gone, he told me; he went yesterday, as did
    also Rubini. I asked him if any other of his 8 children sang, or were
    musical. He replied, “Non, ils sont trop jeunes; l’aîné n’a que douze
    ans.” And the youngest of all, he says, is only <em>2</em> years old.
    There is an opera tomorrow, but the boxes &amp;c., &amp;c. are let, shocking to
    say, at the play-house prices, and “C’est un pasticcio,” he said. It
    is not in the regular number of nights. He said that I have improved
    greatly in my singing since he has sung with me. After the last trio,
    I took leave of <i>il mio buon e caro Maestro</i> with <em>great</em>
    regret. I must repeat again that he is not only a most delightful,
    patient, and agreeable master, but a most good-humoured, pleasing,
    agreeable and honest man; his manners are very gentlemanly and quiet,
    and he has something very frank, open and honest in his countenance;
    everybody who knows him agrees in his being such a good man. I have had
    <em>26</em> lessons of Lablache and shall think back with great delight
    on them; and shall look forward with equal delight to next April, when
    I hope Lablache will be here, so that I can resume them again. It was
    such a pleasure to hear his fine voice and to sing with him. Everything
    that is pleasant, alas! passes so quickly in this “wide world of
    troubles.” How often I have experienced that, in greater pleasures,
    when my dear relations have left me! But then there are the pleasant
    <em>recollections</em> of all that is past, and one must be happy one has
    had them. I was exceedingly delighted with this my <em>last</em> lesson;
    the time seemed to fly even faster than usual, for it always appeared
    to me that these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>pleasant lessons were over in an instant. Lablache
    accompanied really very fairly, and when he came to any difficult
    parts, he put in “des accords,” which did just as well. I have already
    mentioned how very obliging he is; he was always ready to sing anything
    I like and to stay as long as I liked. He is extremely active for his
    size, which really is very considerable. It amused me always to see him
    come in and go out of my room; he walked so erect and made such a fine
    dignified bow. So now all, all is over for this season, not only the
    Opera but my favourite singing-lessons too....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 10th August.</i>— ... A propos, I shall never forget
    when, in my first singing-lesson, I was so frightened to sing before
    Lablache, he said in his good-natured way, “Personne n’a jamais eu peur
    de moi,” which I am sure nobody can ever be who knows him....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Claremont</span>, <i>Friday, 16th September</i>.—At ½ past 9 we
    breakfasted, that is to say, dearest Uncle, we two, Lehzen &amp;c., Lady
    Catherine not being well enough, and Uncle’s two gentlemen being gone
    to town. Went up to my room and copied out music. At about a ¼ to 12
    dearest Uncle came and sat with me till ½ p. 12. He talked over many
    important things. He is <em>so</em> clever, <em>so</em> mild, and <em>so</em>
    prudent; <em>he</em> alone can give me good advice on <em>every</em> thing.
    His advice is perfect. He is indeed “il mio secondo padre” or rather
    “<em>solo</em> padre”! for he is indeed like my real father, as I have
    none, and he is so kind and so good to me, he has ever been so to me.
    He has been and always is of such use to me and does <em>so</em> much
    good....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 18th September.</i>—Baron Moncorvo brought yesterday the
    distressing news that the same unfortunate <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>revolution which took
    place in Spain, has likewise taken place in Portugal, and that the
    Queen was forced to proclaim the constitution of 1820 similar to the
    one of 1812.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> It happened between Friday the 9th and Saturday
    the 10th, in the night. I do so feel for poor dear Ferdinand in this
    trying moment, as also for the poor good Queen. The difference between
    this and the one in Spain was: that in <em>Portugal</em> they behaved
    respectfully towards dear Ferdinand and Donna Maria, and in Spain they
    almost insulted the Queen Regent. In Portugal, thank God! no blood
    has been shed. As soon as the Empress heard what had happened, or
    rather what would happen, she hastened to the Palace de Necessidades,
    where Ferdinand and the Queen were, arrived there at 3 o’clock in the
    night, and remained there till all was over. The Princess Isabella,
    the Queen’s Aunt (and the former Regent), also came and remained with
    them. Uncle Leopold was much shocked and distressed when he heard it,
    as were we also, I am sure.... Dear Uncle came up for a minute and
    brought us 3 letters which Van de Weyer had written to him, giving a
    detailed account of these horrid transactions at Lisbon. Van de Weyer’s
    conduct throughout this dreadful business, when everybody else seems
    to have lost their heads and senses, was most courageous, prudent and
    judicious; and if his and Ferdinand’s advice had been followed, the
    Queen would <em>not</em> have been obliged to sign the Promulgation of
    the <cite>Constitution</cite> of 1820. Van de Weyer says that <em>all</em>
    was given up <span lang="fr">“avec la plus <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>affreuse lâcheté!”</span> without a struggle or
    attempt, when <em>all might yet have been saved</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 21st September.</i>— ... Dear Uncle came up and fetched
    us down to breakfast, as he has done already once before, and twice
    for dinner. He always accompanied us upstairs when we went to bed. It
    was our last breakfast with him; I sat, as usual, near him and General
    Goblet.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> To hear dear Uncle speak on any subject is like reading
    a highly instructive book; his conversation is so enlightened, so
    clear. He is universally admitted to be one of the first politicians
    now extant. He speaks so mildly, yet firmly and impartially, about
    Politics. Uncle tells me that Belgium is quite a pattern for its
    organisation, industry and prosperity; the finances are in the greatest
    perfection. Uncle is so beloved and revered by his Belgian subjects,
    that it must be a great compensation for all his extreme trouble. He is
    so mild, gentle and kind, and so clever and firm....</p>

      <span class="small">From a sketch by Princess Victoria.</span></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p><i>Monday, 26th September.</i>— ... Read in the Morning Post of
    today the melancholy and almost incredible news of the <em>death</em>
    of—<em>Malibran</em>!<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> which took place at Manchester on Friday
    night at 12 o’clock, at the early age of 28. She had gone there for
    the festival which took place the week before last, and only sang on
    Tuesday the 13th instant, and tried to do so on the Wednesday but was
    unable, after which she was taken so alarmingly ill that all singing
    was over. On Saturday the account in the papers was that she was out of
    danger, but the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>improvement was only transient and on Friday night
    this wonderful singer and extraordinary person was no more. She will
    be, and is, a very <em>great</em> loss indeed; for, though I liked and
    admired Grisi by far more than Malibran, I admired many parts of the
    latter’s singing very much, in particular those touching and splendid
    low notes which gave one quite a thrill. In point of cleverness and
    genius there is not a doubt that Malibran far surpassed Grisi; for she
    was not proficient alone in singing and acting, she knew Spanish (her
    own language), Italian, French, English, and German perfectly, as also
    various Italian <i>patois</i>. She composed very prettily, drew well,
    rode well on horseback, danced beautifully, and enfin <em>climbed</em>
    well, as General Alava told us, who knew her very well; he said you
    could speak with her on any subject and she was equally <i>à son
    aise</i>. She was born in 1808 at Paris, and is the daughter of a
    famous Spanish singer called <em>Garcia</em>; she married first an old
    French merchant called <em>Malibran</em>, from whom she was divorced;
    and secondly this spring the incomparable violinist De Bériot. Mamma
    saw her make her debut as <em>Maria Garcia</em>, only 16 years old, in
    <cite>Il Crociato</cite>, at the Italian Opera in London, as “un giovinetto
    Cavalier.” There is something peculiarly awful and striking in the
    death of this great Cantatrice, undoubtedly the <em>second in the
    world</em>, (Grisi being the <em>first</em> in <em>my opinion</em>). To be
    thus cut off in the bloom of her youth and the height of her career,
    suddenly, is dreadful!...</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 28th September.</i>— ... The news from Lisbon are far
    from good, I am <em>sorry to say</em>. Mamma received a letter from Van
    de Weyer this morning, dated 11th Sept., in which he said that there
    had been another <i>émeute</i> the afternoon before, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>which however had
    been dissipated, and that both <em>dearest</em> Ferdinand and Donna Maria
    showed great calmness and dignity. It is a great trial for poor dear
    Ferdinand and for the good Queen. Van de Weyer says they are all in a
    very uncomfortable situation....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 30th September.</i>— ... Read in <cite>The Times</cite> last night
    a distressing account of the details of poor Malibran’s illness and
    death. Poor young creature! she seems to have been neglected at a time
    when her life might perhaps still have been saved; for she complained
    of head-ache and shivering the same afternoon she arrived (Sunday 11th
    Sept.). On the Wednesday night after singing that fine but <em>now</em>
    painful Duo “Vanne se alberghi in petto,” she was taken so very very
    ill. Notwithstanding all this she got up on Thursday morning and
    was dressed with the assistance of Mrs. Richardson, landlady of the
    Mosely Arms Hotel at Manchester, for she had no female attendant, a
    man-servant of De Bériot’s being (as is said in the newspapers, for all
    what I have hitherto related about her illness and death is taken from
    the newspapers) their only servant. In spite of every effort to prevent
    her, the poor dying Malibran insisted upon going to the Oratorio that
    morning, and was accordingly carried to her carriage; but being seized
    with hysterics she was instantly taken back. She never left her room,
    and scarcely her bed, from that time till her death. Dr. Belluomini,
    her own Physician, only arrived on Sunday the 18th, though other
    physicians had attended her (from Manchester) before. She was perfectly
    insensible when she died; as also two or 3 days before her death. De
    Bériot was distracted and overpowered on learning of her death, in
    another room <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>whither they had compelled him to retire when it was
    drawing to a close. He never saw her afterwards, and left the place 2
    hours after all was over. It is the most melancholy end that could be
    imagined! To come to an inn in a foreign land with nobody to nurse her,
    and <em>die</em> there! What a sad and tragical end to her bright career!
    I can still hardly believe it possible that she, whom I can see before
    me as she was at our own concert, dressed in white satin, so merry and
    lively, and whose pathetic voice when speaking I can hear, is now in
    the silent tomb; for the funeral was to take place at 10 o’clock this
    morning with great splendour. And so today, all, all is over with poor
    Malibran!...</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 9th October.</i>— ... We went to the church at Ramsgate with
    Lady Catherine and Lehzen. Mr. Harvey preached. The text was from the
    5th chapter of the 2nd Epistle to Cor., 10th verse: “For we must all
    appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every man may receive
    the things done in his body according to that he hath done, whether it
    be good or bad.” Came home at 20 minutes to 1. Wrote my journal. Copied
    out music. At a ¼ to 3 we went to the chapel with Lady Catherine and
    dear Lehzen, &amp;c. The service was read by Mr. Lewis, and Dr. Longley
    (late Master of Harrow School) preached, and <em>most beautifully</em>;
    so mildly and emphatically; his voice is very good, his pronunciation
    very pure, his delivery calm and impressive, his language beautiful yet
    simple, and his appearance very pleasing. He must be between 30 and 40,
    I should say. The text was from the 3rd chapter of Daniel, 16th, 17th,
    and 18th verses: “Shadrach, Meshech, and Abed-nego answered and said to
    the King, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>careful to answer thee in this
    matter. If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
    the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of thine hand, O
    King. But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not serve
    thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.” It was a
    most beautiful sermon in every way, and I was <em>very much</em> pleased
    and impressed with it. Dr. Longley is to be Bishop of Ripon....<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 27th October.</i>— ... Read in <cite>The Conquest of
    Granada</cite> while my hair was doing. At 9 we breakfasted. Wrote a
    letter to my brother. At 10 came the Dean till ½ p. 11. Read with him
    in the N.T., in <cite>The Life of Colonel Hutchinson</cite>, and in Paley.
    <cite>The Life of Colonel Hutchinson</cite> is written by his wife, who wrote
    it for her children after their father’s death. Colonel Hutchinson
    lived in the time of Charles I., the Commonwealth, and even of Charles
    II. He was on the Puritanical side, and though a very good man, signed
    the King’s death-warrant, being very <em>strong</em> on his side, which
    is to be seen by Mrs. Hutchinson’s writings; his and her feelings being
    totally opposite to Clarendon’s, render it interesting, though it is
    more a private account of his life than any public History of the
    Times, but of course a good deal of history will be mixed up in it as
    Col. Hutchinson had a good deal to do in the wars. Mrs. Hutchinson’s
    style is remarkably quaint and ancient, indeed in some parts so much so
    as to render it almost ridiculous, but there are again some very pretty
    feeling parts in it (indeed feeling and pious throughout it), one of
    which, in which she speaks of her husband and herself I shall quote;
    before I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>do so, however, I must say that the editor, a descendant
    of the family, has left the orthography just as she wrote it, which
    is very antiquated and imperfect: “The greatest excellence she (Mrs.
    Hutchinson) had was the power of apprehending and the vertue of loving
    his (Col. H.’s) soe as his shadow, she waited on him every where,
    till he was taken into that region of light, which admits of none,
    and then she vanisht into nothing.” There is likewise another passage
    speaking of a son she lost: “... call’d by his owne name John, who
    liv’d scarce six yeares, and was a very hopefull child, full of his
    father’s vigor and spiritt, but death soone nipt that blossome.” Lehzen
    of course still continues reading to me while I dress, the delightful
    letters of Mme. de Sévigné; we are now in the middle of the 10th vol.,
    and I like them more and more, they are so beautiful, so easy, they
    show the character of the person who wrote them so perfectly, you
    become acquainted with her and hers, and there are such tender and
    beautiful feelings expressed in them, towards that daughter who was
    her all &amp; all; and the style is so elegant and so beautiful. I shall
    quote a passage relating to a vexation she had about not procuring the
    “députation” for her son M. de Sévigné: “Ne faut-il point être juste
    et se mettre à la place des gens? c’est ce qu’on ne fait jamais.” How
    true this is. Then how pretty this is, in writing to Mme. de Grignan:
    “Vous me louez trop de la douce retraite que je fais ici; rien n’y est
    pénible que votre absence.” There is certainly nothing so beautiful
    of the kind, in any language as these letters. I shall just quote two
    passages from the extracts in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite> of Sir James
    Mackintosh’s life, about Mme. de Sévigné: “In the midst of all the
    rage felt at Paris against <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>King William, the admirable good-sense and
    natural moderation of Mme. de Sévigné catches a glimpse of his real
    character, through the mists of Rome and Versailles: ‘Le prince n’a
    pas songé à faire périr son beau-père. Il est à Londres, à la place
    du Roi, sans en prendre le nom, ne voulant que rétablir une religion
    qu’il croit bonne, et maintenir les loix du pays sans qu’il en coûte
    une goutte de sang.... Pour le Roi d’Angleterre il y (St. Germains)
    parait content,—et c’est pour cela qu’il est là.’ Observe the perfect
    good-sense of the last remark, and the ease and liveliness with which
    it is made. Tacitus and Machiavel could have said nothing better; but
    a superficial reader will think no more of it than the writer herself
    seems to do.”—Again, further on: “The style of Mme. de Sévigné is
    evidently copied not only by her worshipper Walpole, but even by Gray;
    who notwithstanding the extraordinary merits of his matter, has the
    double stiffness of an imitator and of a college recluse....”</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 28th October.</i>—I awoke at 7 and got up at 20 minutes to
    8. Read in the <cite>Exposition</cite> while my hair was doing. Received a
    most kind dear and pretty letter from dearest Aunt Louise, from which
    I will copy a passage: “I have today not much to say. It is my brother
    Nemours’ birthday; and in the same time, the anniversary of the death
    of my dear governess” (Mme. de Mallet, who died when Aunt Louise was at
    Paris last year) “of the best and truest friend I had for twenty years,
    to make me melancholy. In her was broken the first link of the chain of
    my strong and youthful affections. How many more shall I live perhaps
    to see destroyed?” How pretty and feeling this is; it comes straight
    from her dear good heart. I can well say of my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span><em>precious</em> Lehzen
    what she says of Mme. de Mallet, that she is my “best and truest
    friend” I have had for nearly 17 years and I trust I shall have for 30
    or 40 and <em>many</em> more!...</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 1st November.</i>— ... Read in <cite>The Conquest of
    Granada</cite>, and wrote my journal. There are two lines in <cite>Rokeby</cite>
    (which is so full of beauty that I could copy the whole and not find
    one part which is not full of loveliness, sweetness, grace, elegance,
    and feeling, for the immortal bard who wrote these beautiful poems
    never <em>could</em> write an <em>ugly</em> line in <em>my</em> opinion)
    which struck me, as well as the Dean, who is, s’il est permis de le
    dire, poetry-mad, as most splendid.... Oh! Walter Scott is my <i>beau
    idéal</i> of a Poet; I do so admire him both in Poetry and Prose!...</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 3rd November.</i>— ... After 7 we dined. The Duke
    of Wellington, the Countess of Ashburnham,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and Lady Elinor
    Ashburnham,<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Lord and Lady Radstock,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Lord and Lady
    Barham,<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> Colonel Stopford,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Colonel Barnard, Mr. Sicklemore,
    and Mr. Mayhew dined here. I sat between the Duke of Wellington and
    Lord Radstock. The Duke looked remarkably well and was in very good
    spirits. Lady Barham looked very handsome; she had a reddish brown
    velvet turban and a dark velvet dress. She <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>is a likeness of the
    Duchess of Sutherland in dark, but the Duchess is handsomer, in figure
    and all together handsomer, having a finer nose and mouth than Lady
    Barham. Lady Barham has a beautiful brow and fine dark expressive
    eyes with a fine pale complexion, but the lower part of her face,
    particularly the mouth and chin, are not at all good. She looks 28 and
    is only 22....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 6th November.</i>— ... We walked home at 1. Read in
    <cite>Astoria</cite>. Added a few lines to my letter to Feodore. Wrote one to
    Aunt Sophia and my journal. At ½ p. 2 we went out with <em>dearest</em>
    Lehzen and came home at a little before 4. Received a most kind
    letter from dearest Uncle Leopold accompanied by a “supplément
    extraordinaire” to the <cite>Moniteur Universel</cite>, giving an account of
    the “échauffourée” which took place at Strasburg on the 30th October,
    headed by Louis Napoleon Buonaparte,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> a young man of 28 years old,
    son of the Duchesse de St. Leu (Hortense), and who tried to make the
    Troops rise in his favour, but the latter proved faithful to their
    King (Louis Philippe) and country, as they ought; and the Prince and
    Rebels have been put in prison. The Queen of the French sent Uncle the
    paper....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 20th November.</i>— ... Read a letter of Lord Palmerston’s
    to Mamma relative to the late unfortunate affairs at Lisbon, which
    is very consolatory. Marshal Saldanha was charged to bring about the
    reaction, which was to spread first in the provinces and then to the
    capital and the Queen was <em>not</em> to give the first impulse.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>
    Unfortunately poor Donna Maria <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>was hurried into this step by the
    jealousy of those about her. The friends of the Duke of Terceira,
    unwilling that Marshal Saldanha should have the credit of the reaction,
    snatched it out of his hands and brought on all this confusion.
    However, Lord Palmerston concludes with this: “The result of the whole
    is, that the Queen’s position is <em>better</em> than it <em>was</em>, not
    so <em>bad</em> as it <em>might</em> have been after such a failure, but
    <em>much less good</em> than if she had waited patiently till the proper
    time for action had arrived. The Prince behaved throughout with spirit,
    courage and firmness and has acquired by his conduct the respect of
    both parties.” That our beloved and precious Ferdinand has behaved
    in such a way is most <em>delightful</em> for me, who <em>love him</em>
    like the <em>dearest of Brothers</em>. It could not be otherwise, I was
    sure....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 29th November.</i>— ... At 8 we left poor West Cliff
    House.... We reached Canterbury in safety in spite of the rain and
    some wind, but not very long after we left it, it began to blow so
    dreadfully, accompanied by floods of rain at intervals, that our
    carriage swung and the post-boys could scarcely keep on their horses.
    As we approached Sittingbourne, the <em>hurricane</em>, for I cannot
    call it by any other name, became quite frightful and even alarming;
    corn stacks were flying about, trees torn up by their roots, and
    chimneys blown to atoms. We got out, or rather were <em>blown</em> out,
    at Sittingbourne. After staying there for a short while we got into the
    carriage where Lady Theresa and Lehzen were, with them, which being
    larger and heavier than our post-chaise, would not shake so much. For
    the first 4 or 5 miles all went on more smoothly and I began to hope
    our difficulties were at an end. Alas! far from it. The wind blew
    worse than before and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>in going down the hill just before Chatham, the
    hurricane was so tremendous that the horses stopped for a minute, and
    I thought that we were undone, but by dint of whipping and very good
    management of the post-boys we reached Rochester in safety. Here we
    got out, and here it was determined that we must pass the night. Here
    we are therefore, and here we must remain, greatly to my annoyance,
    for I am totally unprepared, Lehzen’s and my wardrobe maid are gone
    on to Claremont, and I hate sleeping at an Inn. I had been so glad at
    the thought of not doing so this time, mais “l’homme propose et Dieu
    dispose,” and it would have been temerity to proceed, for a coach had
    been upset on the bridge just before we arrived, and the battlements of
    the bridge itself were totally blown in....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 18th December.</i>— ... I sat between Mr. Croker<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and
    Col. Wemyss.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> Der erste ist ein kluger, aber nach meiner Meinung,
    nicht angenehmer Mann; er spricht zu viel. He has a very excellent
    memory and tells anecdotes cleverly but with a peculiar pronunciation
    of the <em>r</em>. He said that the Duke of Wellington had told him that
    the character of the 3 nations, the English, Scotch, and Irish, was
    very apparent in the army. He said (the Duke), “It may seem like a joke
    what I am going to say, but it is quite true; the <em>Scotch</em> were
    pleased when the <em>money</em> arrived, the <em>Irish</em> when they got
    into a <em>wine country</em>, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>and the <em>English</em> when the <em>roast
    beef</em> came up.” He told many anecdotes and made many remarks upon
    the various nations, ein wenig sehr stark. Il aime trop à étaler, il
    n’a pas de tacte; il prend trop le ton supérieur....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Claremont</span>, <i>Saturday, 24th December (Xmas Eve)</i>.—I awoke
    after 7 and got up at 8. After 9 we breakfasted. At a little after 10
    we left Kensington with dearest Lehzen, Lady Conroy and—<em>Dashy</em>!
    and reached Claremont at a ¼ to 12. Played and sang. At 2 dearest
    Lehzen, Victoire and I [? went out] and came home at 20 minutes p. 3.
    No one was stirring about the Gipsy encampment except George, which
    I was sorry for, as I was anxious to know how our poor friends were
    after this bitterly cold night. Played and sang. Received from dearest
    best Lehzen as a Christmas box: 2 lovely little Dresden china figures,
    2 pair of lovely little chased gold buttons, a small lovely button
    with an angel’s head which she used to wear herself, and a pretty
    music book; from good Louis a beautiful piece of Persian stuff for
    an album; and from Victoire and Emily Gardiner a small box worked by
    themselves. Wrote my journal. Went down to arrange Mamma’s table for
    her. At 6 we dined. Mr. Edmund Byng<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> and Mr. Conroy dined here.
    Mr. Byng is going to stay here a night or two. Very soon after dinner
    Mamma sent for us into the Gallery, where all the things were arranged
    on different tables. From my dear Mamma I received a beautiful massive
    gold buckle in the shape of two serpents; a lovely little delicate gold
    chain with a turquoise clasp; a lovely coloured sketch of dearest Aunt
    Louise by Partridge, copied <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>from the picture he brought, and so like
    her; 3 beautiful drawings by Munn, one lovely sea view by Purser, and
    one beautiful cattle piece by Cooper (all coloured), 3 prints, a book
    called <cite>Finden’s Tableaux</cite>, <cite>Heath’s Picturesque Annual for
    1837, Ireland</cite>; both these are very pretty; <cite>Friendship’s
    Offering</cite>, and <cite>The English Annual for 1837</cite>, <cite>The Holy
    Land</cite> illustrated beautifully, two handkerchiefs, a very pretty
    black satin apron trimmed with red velvet, and two almanacks. I am very
    thankful to my dear Mamma for all these very pretty things. From dear
    Uncle Leopold, a beautiful turquoise ring; from the Queen a fine piece
    of Indian gold tissue; and from Sir J. Conroy a print. I gave my dear
    Lehzen a green morocco jewel case, and the <cite>Picturesque Annual</cite>;
    Mamma gave her a shawl, a dress, a pair of turquoise earrings, an
    annual, and handkerchiefs. I then took Mamma to the Library where my
    humble table was arranged. I gave her a bracelet made of my hair,
    the clasp of which contains Charles’, Feodore’s and my hair; and the
    <cite>Keepsake</cite> and <cite>Oriental Annual</cite>. Lehzen gave her two pair of
    little buttons just like mine. I danced a little with Victoire. Stayed
    up till 11.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 25th December (Xmas day).</i>—At 9 we all breakfasted.
    Mamma, Lehzen and I read prayers. Arranged my new drawings. At a little
    before 2 dearest Lehzen, Victoire and I went out and came home at 3. As
    we were approaching <em>the camp</em>,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> we met Rea coming from it,
    who had been sent there by Mamma to enquire into the story of these
    poor wanderers. He told us (what I was quite sure of before) that all
    was quite true, that the poor young woman and baby were doing very
    well, though very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>weak and miserable and that what they wanted chiefly
    was fuel and nourishment. Mamma has ordered broth and fuel to be sent
    tonight, as also 2 blankets; and several of our people have sent old
    flannel things for them. Mamma has ordered that the broth and fuel is
    to be sent each day till the woman is recovered. Lehzen sent them by
    our footmen a little worsted knit jacket for the poor baby, and when we
    drove by, Aunt Sarah,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> the old woman and the Husband all looked out
    and bowed most gratefully. Rea gave them directly a sovereign. I cannot
    say how happy I am that these poor creatures are assisted, for they are
    such a nice set of Gipsies, so quiet, so affectionate to one another,
    so discreet, not at all forward or importunate, and <em>so</em> grateful;
    so unlike the gossiping, fortune-telling race-gipsies; and this is such
    a peculiar and touching case. Their being assisted makes me quite merry
    and happy today, for yesterday night when I was safe and happy at home
    in that cold night and today when it snowed so and everything looked
    white, I felt quite unhappy and grieved to think that our poor gipsy
    friends should perish and shiver for want; and now today I shall go to
    bed happy, knowing they are better off and more comfortable....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 29th December.</i>— ... At 12 we went out with dear Lehzen
    and came home at 2. Everything still looked very white and the ground
    rather slippery but not so much as yesterday. It snowed part of the
    time we were walking. I saw Aunt Sarah and the least pretty of the two
    sisters-in-law, who has returned, in a shop at Esher. How I <em>do</em>
    wish I could do something for their <em>spiritual</em> and <em>mental</em>
    benefit and for the education of their children and in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>particular for
    the poor little baby who I have known since its birth, in the admirable
    manner Mr. Crabbe in his <cite>Gipsies’ Advocate</cite> so strongly urges; he
    beseeches and urges those who have kind hearts and Christian feelings
    to think of these poor wanderers, who have many good qualities and
    who have many good people amongst them. He says, and alas! I <em>too
    well</em> know its truth, from experience, that whenever any poor
    Gipsies are encamped anywhere and crimes and robberies &amp;c. occur, it
    is invariably laid to their account, which is shocking; and if they
    are always looked upon as vagabonds, how <em>can</em> they become good
    people? I trust in Heaven that the day may come when <em>I</em> may do
    something for these poor people, and for this particular family! I am
    sure that the little kindness which they have experienced from us will
    have a good and lasting effect on them!...</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> was her <i>annus mirabilis</i>, her wonder-year. The earlier
      months passed much as usual. On 24th May she was eighteen years
      old. The entry in her Journal shows some presentiment of what was
      to come. In less than a month she had stepped from out of the
      precincts of that quiet, ill-furnished palace in Kensington Gardens
      into the full glare of the Throne. The 20th June was her most
      wonderful day, but although keenly alive to its significance and
      glory, she never lost her self-control. The hidden forces which
      even her Journals failed to reveal, appear so to have moulded her
      character that she was enabled to appreciate and yet resist the
      glamours of this supreme moment. There is not a trace of doubt or
      misgiving. She was conscious of a mysterious duty imposed upon
      her by Divine Providence, and although she obviously felt her
      inexperience, she never for a moment doubted her fitness for her
      task. King William died at Windsor soon after two in the morning,
      and three hours later the Archbishop and Lord Conyngham were at
      Kensington Palace. The Princess received them in a dressing-gown
      hastily thrown over her nightdress, her feet in slippers, and her
      fair hair loose about her head. Four hours later she received for
      the first time Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, who was destined
      until the day of her marriage to exercise a potent influence
      over her thoughts and actions. Her caution in the selection of
      confidantes, her wariness in granting her approval, and her care to
      safeguard the regal tradition, are clearly apparent from the day of
      her accession. Although she accepted advice, she never appeared to
      yield. There is nothing in these Journals that displays the inner
      thoughts of the Queen, in a light differing from that in which her
      conduct appeared both to her Ministers and to her courtiers. Then,
      as in after-years, she fulfilled the hope publicly expressed by
      Lord John Russell, that she would prove to be an Elizabeth without
      her tyranny and an Anne without her weakness.</p>

    <p>It must be remembered that from the day of her accession the Crowns
      of Great Britain and Hanover were divided. Her uncle, Ernest, Duke
      of Cumberland, succeeded to the Throne of Hanover. The fear that
      he might succeed to the Throne of Great Britain had always haunted
      the minds of the people, and added to the feeling of gladness with
      which they welcomed the young Queen. On the second day of her reign
      the name Alexandrina was dropped for ever, and she was thenceforth
      known, as she desired to be, by the name of Victoria.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER VI<br>1837</div>

  <p><i>Sunday, 8th January.</i>— ... The service was performed by the Dean,
    who gave us likewise a sermon. The text was from the 1st Chapter of
    Isaiah,—verse:—“Wash you, make you clean.” At 12 dear Lehzen and I went
    out and came home at 10 minutes p. 1. It is today a week that we took
    leave of our poor good friends the Gipsies, and I am quite sorry when
    I pass the spot so long enlivened by their little camp, and behold it
    empty and deserted, and with almost no trace to be seen of their ever
    having been there. They had been there more than a month, for they
    encamped there about 5 days after we arrived here and have been there
    ever since until last Wednesday or Thursday. To <em>my</em> feeling, the
    chief ornament of the Portsmouth Road is gone since their departure.
    But this is their life; they are happy and grateful and we have done
    them some good. The place and spot may be forgotten, but the Gipsy
    family Cooper will <em>never</em> be obliterated from my memory!...</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 10th January.</i>— ... At a ¼ p. 3 came M. Van de Weyer,
    who arrived in London last night from Lisbon. He gave us most
    interesting and most valuable information about Portugal; praised our
    <em>dearest</em> Ferdinand to the skies, said he showed cleverness,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>firmness, and character which no other young man of his age hardly
    ever showed; said the poor Queen was totally indifferent to whatever
    happened, but was extremely obedient to Ferdinand who had great power
    over her. He told us much to distress us, but said that the present
    ministers were ready to do anything that was right. He is a most
    clever, clear-sighted, sensible little man, Van de Weyer himself. He
    looks much careworn and fatigued, and <em>no</em> wonder at it....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 7th February.</i>—Read in <cite>Bajazet</cite>. Read to Lehzen
    out of <cite>Polyeucte</cite> and finished it; it is certainly <em>very</em>
    beautiful and full of most beautiful and highminded feelings, but the
    end is, to my feelings, rather unnatural. Lehzen dictated to me some
    passages from <cite>Polyeucte</cite>....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 9th February.</i>— ... Read to dear Lehzen out
    of the newspapers Lord John Russell’s very able and judicious
    speech on bringing in the Irish Corporation bill; and out of the
    Irish History.... Read in <cite>Bajazet</cite> and wrote my journal.
    Lehzen dictated French to me. Played and sang. Read in Raumer’s
    <cite>Königinnen</cite>. Read in Clive’s life<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> while my hair was doing.
    At 6 we dined. Read in <cite>Bajazet</cite>. Sang, and Mamma also. Stayed up
    till 10. Read in School Shakespeare while my hair was undoing.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 8th April.</i>—At 10 came the Dean till 11. Read with
    him in the N.T. and in Boswell’s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>. At ½ p. 11 I
    went down and sat to Mr. Lane<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> till a ¼ to 1. He showed me 4 very
    beautiful <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>coloured drawings by Chalon, 3 portraits,—Mrs. Ashley, very
    like; Miss Fanny Wyndham as Contino in <cite>Scaramuccia</cite>, ridiculously
    like; and Bellini as Figaro; the 4th is a very beautiful head and hands
    of Juliet asleep after she has taken the draught. Mr. Lane likewise
    showed me a very beautiful miniature of Lady Blessington<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> painted
    by Chalon about 15 years ago; and a beautiful drawing of C. Kemble as
    Falstaff, done by himself. He is a great friend of Kemble’s and admires
    him beyond everything. He is also very intimate with Mr. Macready, and
    says he is such an excellent father and husband. Charles Mathews, he
    says, speaks Italian as well as he does French.... At 20 minutes p.
    7 we went with dear Lehzen, Lady Theresa, Charles and Lord Ilchester
    &amp;c. to the Opera. It was my dear <cite>I Puritani</cite>, and they were
    singing the opening Chorus when we came in. Grisi, Rubini, Lablache,
    and Tamburini made their first appearance this season, and were all
    enthusiastically cheered on their appearance, in particular my worthy
    Master and Rubini. There is not a word of truth in what was said about
    Grisi, for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>I never saw anything look more lovely that she did, and
    she sang deliciously, as did also Rubini whose voice seems to get if
    possible finer each year. It is useless to add that the singing of
    these 4 incomparable and unequalled <i>artistes</i> was, as always,
    perfection! with the exception perhaps of Lablache’s being a little
    hoarse at times; he did not look well and was not in his usual spirits
    I thought. The Quartet “Ah! te o cara,” the Polacca, “Suoni la tromba,”
    and “Ella è tremante” were all loudly encored. After the Opera was over
    the 4 cantanti were called out and loudly cheered....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 11th April.</i>—Heard that poor Lady De L’Isle,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> the
    King’s eldest daughter, had expired at 10 o’clock the night before.
    On the death of old Mrs. Strode last February, the King made Lady De
    L’Isle housekeeper of Kensington Palace; and she arrived here about 2
    or 3 days after we came from Claremont, was confined with a daughter
    about a month ago, and was going on very well, when she was taken so
    alarmingly ill, I think on Sunday. It is very awful and very dreadful
    for her 4 poor children.</p>

  <p>After 9 we breakfasted. At a little before 10 came the Dean till 12
    minutes to 11. Read with him in the N.T. and in Hume. At 11 came my
    good Lablache and stayed till 6 minutes to 12. He was as good-humoured,
    kind, ready, and gentlemanlike as ever; there never is any difference
    in his manners or ways, may he be ill, well, tired or not tired, he is
    always in the same ready good-humour. He is perhaps a little greyer,
    <i>mais voilà tout</i>. He was in splendid voice and sang beautifully.
    It was quite a delight for me to hear his fine and unique voice
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>again and to sing with him; it is such a support to my voice and he
    accompanies so agreeably. I sang first with him the favourite duo of
    mine: “Voglio dire,” from <cite>L’Elisire d’Amore</cite>; then “Una furtiva
    lagrima,” a pretty little Aria from the same opera, which I repeated
    and which Catone used to sing so nicely, as also “Quanto è bella quanto
    è cara” from <cite>L’Elisir</cite>, which I also sung. After this Lablache
    sang with Mamma and me “Se il fratel stringere” from <cite>Belisario</cite>,
    which he <em>had never seen</em> or even <em>heard</em> before!...</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 20th April.</i>—I got up at 8. Read in the
    <cite>Exposition</cite> while my hair was doing. After 9 we breakfasted.
    Played and sang; practised for Lablache. Drew. At 20 minutes to 2 we
    went to the Drawing Room with dear Lehzen, Lady Mary Stopford,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
    Sir George Anson &amp;c. The poor Queen not being well, the King held the
    Drawing-room, and (strange to say) Princess Augusta represented her.
    There were several young ladies presented, amongst whom were Lady
    Wilhelmina Stanhope (daughter to the Earl and Countess Stanhope),<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
    a beautiful girl; Lady Fanny Cowper<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> (daughter to the Earl and
    Countess Cowper), also pretty; Lady Mary <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>Grimston,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Miss Louisa
    Percy,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Miss Wynn (niece to the Duchess of Northumberland),
    Victoire Conroy, &amp;c. The poor Duchess of Northumberland was unable to
    attend me, having a bad cold. We came home at 20 minutes p. 3....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 19th May.</i>—Got up at 8. Wrote the <i>brouillon</i> of a
    French letter to dearest Aunt Louise while my hair was doing. After
    9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. At 10 Mary,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
    Lehzen, I and the children went out walking and came home at 10 minutes
    to 11. Wrote my letter to dearest Aunt Louise. At ½ p. 11 came M.
    Guazzaroni till 12. Received a letter from <em>the King</em> by Lord
    Conyngham....</p>

  <p>Read in W. Scott’s Life. Received an address from the Mayor and City of
    Lincoln, which was presented by Colonel Sibthorp<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> and Mr. Edward
    Lytton Bulwer,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> the two Members. I was attended by my dearest
    Lehzen, and Mamma by Lady Flora. Played and sung &amp;c. Wrote my journal.
    Drew. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>Felt very miserable and agitated. Did not go down to dinner, but
    dined in my own room at 8 o’clock. Stayed up till 10.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 20th May.</i>—Got up after 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The
    dear children were in the room and played very merrily. Wrote a letter
    to the King, which Mamma had previously written for me. At 3 minutes
    past 11 came my buon Maestro Lablache, looking pale and coughing, and
    complaining he was still unwell and feared he would remain so till the
    weather became warmer....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 24th May.</i>—Today is my 18th birthday! How old! and yet
    how far am I from being what I should be. I shall from this day take
    the <em>firm</em> resolution to study with renewed assiduity, to keep my
    attention always well fixed on whatever I am about, and to strive to
    become every day less trifling and more fit for what, if Heaven wills
    it, I’m some day to be!... At ½ p. 3 we drove out with Mary and dear
    Lehzen and came home at 5. The demonstrations of loyalty and affection
    from all the people were highly gratifying. The parks and streets
    were thronged and everything looked like a <em>Gala</em> day. Numbers
    of people put down their names and amongst others good old Lablache
    inscribed his.... At ½ p. 10 we went to the ball at St. James’s with
    the Duchess of Northumberland, dear Lehzen, Lady Flora and Lady Conroy
    &amp;c. The King though much better was unable of course to be there, and
    the Queen neither, so that, strange to say, Princess Augusta made the
    <i>honneurs</i>! I danced first with Lord Fitzalan,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> 2ndly with
    Prince Nicholas Esterhazy,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>who is a very amiable, agreeable,
    gentlemanly young man; 3rdly with the Marquis of Granby<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>; 4thly
    with the Marquis of Douro<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> who is very odd and amusing; and 5thly
    and lastly with the Earl of Sandwich<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> who is an agreeable young
    man. I wished to dance with Count Waldstein who is such an amiable man,
    but he replied that he could not dance quadrilles, and as in my station
    I unfortunately cannot valse and gallop, I could not dance with him.
    The beauties there were (in my opinion) the Duchess of Sutherland,
    Lady Frances (or Fanny) Cowper, who is very pleasing, natural and
    clever-looking.... The Courtyard and the streets were crammed when we
    went to the Ball, and the anxiety of the people to see poor stupid me
    was very great, and I must say I am quite touched by it, and feel proud
    which I always have done of my country and of the English Nation. I
    forgot to say that before we went to dinner we saw the dear children. I
    gave my beloved Lehzen a small brooch of my hair.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 26th May.</i>— ... Wrote a letter to dear Uncle Leopold,
    to dearest Albert from whom I received a most kind and affectionate
    letter for my birthday yesterday, and to Ernest Hohenlohe. Finished
    my <i>brouillon</i> of Aunt’s letter and began to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>write it. At 2 we
    went with dear Lehzen and I received two more Addresses, one from
    Kidderminster presented (not <em>read</em>) by Lord Foley<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>; the other
    from the Borough of Louth by ——. First of all the Sheriffs of the
    City came and wished to know when we should be pleased to receive the
    Address from the Mayor and Corporation of London....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 29th May.</i>—At ½ p. 1 we went to the Drawing-Room with
    the Duchess of Northumberland, dear Lehzen, Lady Mary Stopford, Lady
    Catherine Jenkinson, Lady Flora Hastings, Lady Cust, Sir George
    Anson, &amp;c. The King and Queen being both unwell, though better, the
    Drawing-room was held by the Princess Augusta!! It was an immensely
    full one—2000 people, and we did not get home till a ¼ p. 5. The
    handsomest people there were: the Duchess of Sutherland, Lady Fanny
    Cowper, the Marchioness of Abercorn,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Lady Seymour,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Mrs.
    Blackwood, &amp;c., &amp;c. Countess Emanuel Zichy (Miss Strachan that was)
    and who was also at our Concert, was presented. Count Zichy is very
    good-looking in uniform, but not in plain clothes. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>Count Waldstein
    looks remarkably well in his pretty Hungarian uniform....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 30th May.</i>—At ½ p. 2 we went into the saloon with Mary
    and Princess Sophia, I being attended by the Duchess of Northumberland
    and dear Lehzen, and Mamma by all her ladies and gentlemen. The Lord
    Mayor, Aldermen and Commons of the City of London presented Mamma 1st
    with an Address to which she read an answer, and then me with a very
    kind one. I only answered the following words, from my own accord: “I
    am very thankful for your kindness and my Mother has expressed all my
    feelings.” The Addresses were read by the Recorder of London (Mr. Law).
    There were all together 150 who came up with the Lord Mayor....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 4th June.</i>—Read in the <cite>Exposition</cite> while my hair
    was doing. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room.
    Wrote a letter to dear Feodore. Drew. At 11 we went to Chapel with
    dear Lehzen. The whole service was performed by Mr. Jackson. Wrote
    my journal. Wrote. Drew. At a little after 3 came my good and honest
    friend, <em>Stockmar</em>,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and stayed with me till ½ p. 3. He had
    a very pleasant and useful conversation with me; he is one of those
    few people who tell plain honest truth, don’t flatter, give wholesome
    necessary advice, and strive to do good and smooth all dissensions.
    He is Uncle Leopold’s greatest and most confidential attached and
    disinterested friend, and I hope he is the same to me, at least, I feel
    so towards him; Lehzen being of course the <em>greatest</em> friend I
    have....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 15th June.</i>—After 9 we breakfasted. The children played
    in the room. At 10 Mary, dear <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>Lehzen and I drove out and came home at
    10 minutes to 11. <em>Wrote!!</em> The news of the King are so very bad
    that all my lessons save the Dean’s are put off, including Lablache’s,
    Mrs. Anderson’s, Guazzaroni’s, &amp;c., &amp;c., and we see <em>nobody</em>. I
    regret rather my singing-lesson, though it is only for a short period,
    but duty and <em>proper feeling</em> go before <em>all pleasures</em>.—10
    minutes to 1,—I just hear that the Doctors think my poor Uncle the
    King cannot last more than 48 hours! Poor man! he was always kind to
    me, and he <em>meant</em> it well I know; I am grateful for it, and
    shall ever remember his kindness with gratitude. He was odd, very odd
    and singular, but his intentions were often ill interpreted!—Wrote
    my journal. At about a ¼ p. 2 came Lord Liverpool and I had a highly
    important conversation with him—<em>alone</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 16th June.</i>— ... Began and read to Lehzen out of De
    Lolme, <cite>On the English Constitution</cite>. I forgot to mention that
    Lehzen finished reading to me on the 16th of May the delightful letters
    of Mme. de Sévigné, and began on the following day <cite>Les Mémoires de
    l’Impératrice Joséphine</cite>, par Mdlle. Le Normand, en 2 tomes, which
    is written in a very affected and flourished style, but is amusing. The
    news of the poor King were a shade better. At a little after 5 we drove
    out with Mary and Lehzen and came home at a ¼ to 7. At ½ p. 7 we dined.
    Saw the children before dinner. Sang <i>un poco</i>. Stayed up till ½
    p. 10.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 17th June.</i>—Read in the <cite>Exposition</cite> while my hair
    was doing. After 9 we breakfasted. The children played in the room. At
    10 Mary, dear Lehzen, the dear children and I drove out and came home
    at 11. I like Mary very much; she is a very honest, warm-hearted, good
    soul, and very susceptible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>of kindness shown to her; she is extremely
    discreet and retiring too. The news of the King are worse again today.
    Wrote my journal &amp;c. Arranged some prints &amp;c. At a little after 2 came
    Baron Stockmar and stayed till near 3. The news of the poor King were
    <em>very</em> bad! Drew. At a ¼ to 5 we drove out with Mary, Lehzen and
    dear little Edward, who was very funny and amusing. We came home at
    6....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 18th June.</i>—Got up at 8. After 9 we breakfasted. The
    children played in the room. At 10 we went down to prayers with dear
    Lehzen. The Dean read and preached. The text was from the 2nd Chapter
    of St. John’s epistle, 5th verse. Drew and painted. Mary came up with
    Edward and stayed some time. Edward also remained alone with me for a ¼
    of an hour. Painted. Saw Stockmar, who brought me a letter from Uncle
    Leopold!!—Painted. The poor King, they say, can live but a few hours
    more!—Wrote my journal....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 19th June.</i>—Got up at a ¼ p. 8. Read in <cite>Les Veillées
    du Château</cite> while my hair was doing. After 9 we breakfasted. The
    children played in the room. At a ¼ p. 10 Mary, Lehzen, the children
    and I drove out and came home at a little after 11. Read in <cite>Les
    Veillées du Château</cite>. Wrote my journal. Saw Dr. Clark. Saw Ernest
    Hohenlohe who brought me the news from Windsor that the poor King was
    <em>so</em> ill that he could hardly live through the day. He likewise
    brought me a very kind message from the poor Queen, and also one from
    the poor old King. After 7 we dined. Saw the children before dinner for
    a minute. Stayed up till a ¼ p. 10. Read in W. Scott’s life while my
    hair was undoing.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 20th June.</i>—I was awoke at 6 o’clock <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>by Mamma, who
    told me that the Archbishop of Canterbury<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and Lord Conyngham<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
    were here, and wished to see me. I got out of bed and went into my
    sitting-room (only in my dressing-gown), and <em>alone</em>, and saw
    them. Lord Conyngham (the Lord Chamberlain) then acquainted me that my
    poor Uncle, the King, was no more, and had expired at 12 minutes p. 2
    this morning, and consequently that I am <em>Queen</em>. Lord Conyngham
    knelt down and kissed my hand, at the same time delivering to me the
    official announcement of the poor King’s demise. The Archbishop then
    told me that the Queen was desirous that he should come and tell me the
    details of the last moments of my poor, good Uncle; he said that he had
    directed his mind to religion, and had died in a perfectly happy, quiet
    state of mind, and was quite prepared for his death. He added that the
    King’s sufferings at the last were not very great but that there was a
    good deal of uneasiness. Lord Conyngham, whom I charged to express my
    feelings of condolence and sorrow to the poor Queen, returned directly
    to Windsor. I then went to my room and dressed.</p>

  <p>Since it has pleased Providence to place me in this station, I shall
    do my utmost to fulfil my duty towards my country; I am very young and
    perhaps in many, though not in all things, inexperienced, but I am
    sure, that very few have more real good will and more real desire to do
    what is fit and right than I have.</p>

  <p>Breakfasted, during which time good faithful Stockmar<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> came and
    talked to me. Wrote a letter <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>to dear Uncle Leopold and a few words to
    dear good Feodore. Received a letter from Lord Melbourne<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> in which
    he said he would wait upon me at a little before 9. At 9 came Lord
    Melbourne, whom I saw in my room, and of <span class="smcap">course</span> <em>quite</em>
    <span class="smcap">alone</span> as I shall <em>always</em> do all my Ministers. He kissed
    my hand and I then acquainted him that it had long been my intention
    to retain him and the rest of the present Ministry at the head of
    affairs, and that it could not be in better hands than his. He then
    again kissed my hand. He then read to me the Declaration which I was to
    read to the Council, which he wrote himself and which is a very fine
    one. I then talked with him some little longer time after which he left
    me. He was in full dress. I like him very much and feel confidence
    in him. He is a very straightforward, honest, clever and good man.
    I then wrote a letter to the Queen. At about 11 Lord Melbourne came
    again to me and spoke to me upon various subjects. At about ½ p. 11
    I went downstairs and held a Council in the red saloon. I went in of
    course quite alone, and remained seated the whole time. My two Uncles,
    the Dukes of Cumberland<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and Sussex,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>and Lord Melbourne
    conducted me. The declaration, the various forms, the swearing in of
    the Privy Councillors of which there were a great number present, and
    the reception of some of the Lords of Council, previous to the Council
    in an adjacent room (likewise alone) I subjoin here. I was not at all
    nervous and had the satisfaction of hearing that people were satisfied
    with what I had done and how I had done it. Receiving after this,
    Audiences of Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord Albemarle (Master
    of the Horse), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, all in my room and
    alone. Saw Stockmar. Saw Clark, whom I named my Physician. Saw Mary.
    Wrote to Uncle Ernest. Saw Ernest Hohenlohe who brought me a kind and
    very feeling letter from the poor Queen. I feel very much for her, and
    really feel that the poor good King was always so kind personally to
    me, that I should be ungrateful were I not to recollect it and feel
    grieved at his death. The poor Queen is wonderfully composed now, I
    hear. Wrote my journal. Took my dinner upstairs alone. Went downstairs.
    Saw Stockmar. At about 20 minutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and remained
    till near 10. I had a very important and a very <em>comfortable</em>
    conversation with him. Each time I see him I feel more confidence
    in him; I find him very kind in his manner too. Saw Stockmar. Went
    down and said good-night to Mamma &amp;c. My <em>dear</em> Lehzen will
    <span class="smcap">always</span> remain with me as my friend but will take no situation
    about me, and I think she is right.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 21st June.</i>—Got up at 8. At 9 we <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>all breakfasted. At
    ½ p. 9 I went to St. James’s in state. Mamma and Lady Mary Stopford
    were in my carriage, and Lord Albemarle, Col. Cavendish, Lady Flora
    Hastings, and Col. Harcourt in the others.... After the Proclamation
    Mamma and the ladies repaired to an adjoining room and left me in
    the Closet. I gave audiences to Lord Melbourne (a long one), the
    Earl Marshal (Duke of Norfolk), and Garter King at Arms (Sir John
    Woods), relative to the funeral of my poor Uncle the late King; to
    Lord Albemarle, Lord Hill, Lord Melbourne (again for some time), and
    the Lord President (Lord Lansdowne). I then held a Privy Council in
    the Throne Room. It was not fully attended and was not the third
    part so full as it had been on the preceding day. The Marquis of
    Anglesey,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Spring Rice),<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
    Lords Wharncliffe,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Ashburton,<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
    and Wynford,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Sir Hussey
    Vivian,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>some Judges were sworn in as Privy Councillors and
    kissed hands. After the Council I gave audiences to Lord Melbourne, the
    Archbishop of Canterbury, and all the Bishops except one or two, the
    Lord Chancellor and all the Judges; Sir Hussey Vivian (Master General
    of the Ordnance), Lord John Russell, Lord Glenelg,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> Mr. Poulett
    Thomson,<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> Lord Howick,<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a>
    Lord Palmerston, and Lord Minto.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>
    I then returned home at 1. I must say it was quite like a dream and
    a sad one, when I was seated in the Closet where but barely 5 weeks
    ago I beheld for the last time my poor Uncle. At 2 came Stockmar till
    after 3. Wrote to the Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Augusta.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
    Walked. Saw the Duke of Norfolk. Wrote my journal. At 7 we dined. At 10
    minutes to 9 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 10. I had an
    agreeable and important and satisfactory conversation with him. Stayed
    up till a ¼ p. 10. Lord Hill told me a curious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>coincidence which is
    that the 21st of June, the day on which I was proclaimed, is likewise
    the anniversary of the Battle of Vittoria!</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 22nd June.</i>—Got up after 8. After 9 we breakfasted.
    The children played in the room. At a ¼ p. 10 I walked out with Mary,
    Lehzen, Charles and Edward, and came home at 20 minutes to 11. Wrote
    to the Duchess of Gloucester. Wrote my journal. At 12 came the Judge
    Advocate General (Mr. Cutlar Ferguson)<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> to submit various sentences
    of Court Martial to me. He is a very clever intelligent man and
    explained all the cases very clearly to me. I, of <em>course</em>, saw
    him alone....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 23rd June.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8. After 9 we breakfasted.
    The children played in the room. I do not mention the <span class="smcap">very</span>
    <em>frequent</em> communications I have with Lord Melbourne, Lord John
    Russell,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., as also the other official letters I
    have to write and receive, for want of time and space. Saw good
    Stockmar, who remained in my room for some time. Saw the Marquis of
    Conyngham, then Lord Hill, who explained to me finally about the
    Court Martials, then Sir Henry Wheatley<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> and Col. Wood, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>who as
    Executors of the late King, brought me his Will. At ½ p. 12 arrived
    Lady Catherine<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> who remained in one of my sitting-rooms till now
    and still remains (4 o’clock) answering letters, &amp;c., &amp;c. Saw the Duke
    of Argyll (Lord Steward) at ½ p. 2. I wrote a letter to the Marchioness
    of Tavistock<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> while Stockmar was here, asking her to become one
    of my Ladies of the Bedchamber. Lay down. Wrote to the Marchioness of
    Lansdowne,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> asking her to become my first Lady of the Bedchamber.
    At ½ p. 5 I drove out with Mary and Lehzen, and came home at ½ p. 6.
    After 7 we all dined. I had a <span class="smcap">great</span> deal of business to do
    after dinner. Saw Stockmar. Received a very kind letter from Lady
    Lansdowne accepting the situation. After dinner came Princess Sophia.
    Stayed up till after 10.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 24th June.</i>—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 we all
    breakfasted. The children played in the room. Wrote a letter to the
    Duke of Sussex, and to good Späth. At 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed
    till 12. He is a very honest, good and kind-hearted, as well as very
    clever man. He told me that Lady Tavistock had accepted the situation.
    And he read to me the answer which I was to give to the address from
    the House of Lords. He told me that the Duke of Argyll would bring
    the Address but would not read it; and consequently I was not to read
    mine. Wrote. At 12 came Lady Catherine Jenkinson and remained in my
    room till near 3. Saw Stockmar at a little after 12. Saw Sir Frederick
    Wetherall.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Saw Lord John Russell. <em>Wrote.</em>—I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>really have
    immensely to do; I receive so many communications from my Ministers but
    I like it very much....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 25th June.</i>—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted.
    The children played in the room. At 10 I went down to prayers with
    Mamma, Mary, Lehzen, and Charles. The service was read by the Dean who
    was much affected when he read the prayers in which my name is now
    mentioned in the place of my poor Uncle, the late King. He preached a
    very good and appropriate sermon; the text of which was from the 3rd
    chapter of the Epistle General of St. Peter, 13th and 14th verses....
    At a few minutes p. 12 came the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Spring
    Rice) and stayed some time. He is a very clever and good man.... At
    about 20 minutes p. 4 came Lord Melbourne till 20 minutes p. 5. He is a
    good, honest, kind-hearted and clever man, and I like to talk to him....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 26th June.</i>—Got up at 8. Before 9 we breakfasted. At ½
    p. 9 went with Mamma to Windsor. I was attended by Lady Tavistock and
    Colonel Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and Mamma by Lady Flora Hastings. We arrived
    at the Castle, which looked very mournful and melancholy with the flag
    half mast high, at about a ¼ p. 11. We went instantly to the poor
    Queen’s apartments.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> She received me <em>most kindly</em> but was at
    first much affected. She <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>however soon regained her self-possession
    and was wonderfully calm and composed. She gave us many painfully
    interesting details of the illness and last moments of my poor Uncle
    the late King. He bore his dreadful sufferings with the most exemplary
    patience and always thanked Heaven when these sufferings were but
    slightly and momentarily alleviated. He was in the happiest state
    of mind possible and his death was worthy his high station. He felt
    so composed and seemed to find so much consolation in Religion. The
    Queen is really a most estimable and excellent person and she bears
    the prospect of the great change she must soon go through in leaving
    Windsor and changing her position in a most admirable, strong and
    high-minded manner. I do not think her looking ill and the widow’s
    cap and weeds rather become her. I saw Ernest Hohenlohe, Gustav and
    Prince Ernest of Hesse P.B. We left Windsor at ½ p. 12. It gave me a
    very painful feeling to think that the remains of my poor Uncle were
    in the Castle. Altogether the whole rather upset me. We came at ½ p.
    2. I forgot to say that Lord Melbourne told me that the Duchess of
    Sutherland<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> has accepted the office of Mistress of the Robes, and
    the Countess of Charlemont<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> of one of my ladies of the Bedchamber.
    At ½ p. 2 came the Duchess of Sutherland, whom I am delighted to have
    as my Mistress of the Robes; she was looking so handsome and nice. At
    about 10 minutes to 4 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 4. I
    talked with him as usual on Political affairs, about my Household, and
    various other <em>Confidential</em> affairs....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 27th June.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8. At a ¼ to 10 we
    breakfasted. The children played in the room. Wrote my journal. At
    about 20 minutes p. 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 12. At
    a little after ½ p. 12 came Lord Palmerston and stayed till a little
    p. 1. He is a clever and agreeable man. Saw Lord John Russell and
    Lord Melbourne for a minute. At a few minutes p. 2 I went down into
    the saloon with Lady Lansdowne; Col. Cavendish, the Vice-Chamberlain
    (Lord Charles Fitzroy),<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> and the Comptroller of the Household (Mr.
    Byng)<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> were in waiting. Lord Melbourne then came in and announced
    that the Addresses from the House of Commons were ready to come in.
    They were read by Lord John Russell and I read an answer to both. Lord
    Melbourne stood on my left hand and Lady Lansdowne behind me. Most
    of the Privy Councillors of the House of Commons were present. After
    this Lord Palmerston brought in the Earl of Durham,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> who is just
    returned from St. Petersburg. I conferred on him the Grand Cross of the
    Bath. I knighted him with the Sword of State which is so enormously
    heavy that Lord Melbourne was obliged to hold it for me, and I only
    inclined it. I then put the ribbon over his shoulder. After this the
    foreign Ambassadors and Ministers were severally introduced to me by
    Lord Palmerston. I then went upstairs and gave audiences to the Earl
    of Mulgrave<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> and to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>Earl of Durham. The latter gave a long
    account of Russia. Did various things. Saw Stockmar. As I did not feel
    well I did not come down to dinner, but dined upstairs. I went down
    after dinner. Stayed up till 10. I wore the blue Ribbon and Star of the
    Garter in the afternoon....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 1st July.</i>—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted.
    Edward played in the room only, Ernest not being good. Wrote. I repeat
    what I said before that I have <em>so many</em> communications from
    the Ministers, and from me to them, and I get so many papers to sign
    <em>every</em> day, that I have always a <em>very great</em> deal to do;
    but for want of time and space I do not write these things down. I
    <em>delight</em> in this work. Saw Lord Melbourne. At about ½ p. 11 or
    a ¼ to 12 came Mr. Spring Rice. Saw Lord John Russell. Wrote &amp;c. At 2
    came Sir Henry Wheatley to kiss hands upon being appointed my Privy
    Purse. At a little after 2 I saw Stockmar for a minute. At 10 minutes
    p. 2 came Lord Palmerston and stayed till 6 minutes p. 3. We talked
    about Russia and Turkey a good deal &amp;c. He is very agreeable, and
    clear in what he says. Saw Stockmar for some time afterwards. Wrote
    my journal. I forgot to mention that I received a letter from dearest
    Aunt Louise in the morning. The children played in my room for a little
    while. At ½ past 5 I drove out with Mamma and dear Lehzen and came home
    at 20 minutes to 7. At ½ p. 7 we dined. Stayed up till a ¼ p. 10.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 2nd July.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted.
    The children played in the room. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>At 10 I went to prayers with Mamma,
    Mary, and dear Lehzen. The service was performed by the Dean who gave
    us also a very good sermon. The text was from the 6th chapter of St.
    Matthew, 9th and 10th verses. Wrote, signed, &amp;c. Wrote to dear Feodore.
    Received a kind long letter from dear Uncle Leopold. At 10 minutes to 2
    came Lord Melbourne till a few minutes p. 3. Talked with him about many
    important things. He is indeed a most truly honest, straightforward and
    noble-minded man and I esteem myself <em>most</em> fortunate to have such
    a man at the head of the Government; a man in whom I can safely place
    confidence. There are not <em>many</em> like him in this world of deceit!
    Mary and the children came up for a few minutes. At a little before 4
    came Stockmar and stayed till a little before 5. He is a most honest,
    excellent, disinterested and straightforward man, and most exceedingly
    attached and devoted to me; he has been, and is, of the greatest use to
    me....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 8th July.</i>—Got up at a little after 8. At ½ p. 9 we
    breakfasted. The children played in the room. Signed, &amp;c. Sat to Mr.
    Lane for a few minutes. Wrote to the poor Queen from whom I received
    a <em>very</em> kind letter last night; &amp;c., &amp;c. Saw good Stockmar for
    some time. Saw Lord John Russell. At a few minutes p. 12 came my good
    and honest friend Lord Melbourne and stayed till 20 minutes p. 1.
    Talked over many important things. Saw Mr. Spring Rice.... I forgot
    to say that Lord Melbourne wrote me word yesterday evening that Lady
    Mulgrave<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> I was very desirous to become one of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>my Ladies of the
    Bedchamber, and I told Lord Melbourne this morning that I would make
    her one of my ladies. Wrote to Lady Lyttelton<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> to ask her to
    become one of my ladies of the Bedchamber (in a <em>year</em>), for she
    is still in widow’s weeds.... At a ¼ p. 7 I, Mamma, Mary and Lehzen
    dined, Charles having gone at 5 o’clock to Windsor to attend the
    funeral of my poor Uncle, the late King. It was very very sad to hear
    from ½ p. 8 till nearly 10 o’clock, those dreadful minute guns! Alas!
    my poor Uncle, he now reposes in quiet and peace! As Lord Melbourne
    said to me, the first morning when I became Queen, that the poor King
    “had his faults as we all have, but that he possessed many valuable
    qualities.” I have heard from all sides that he was really very fond of
    me, and I shall <em>ever</em> retain a grateful sense of his kindness to
    me and shall never forget him. Life is short and uncertain, and I am
    determined to employ my time well, so that when I am called away from
    this world my end may be a peaceful and a happy one!...</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 11th July.</i>—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. The
    children played in the room. At a little after 10, sat to Mr. Lane for
    a few minutes. Saw Col. Cavendish. Wrote, &amp;c., &amp;c. At ½ p. 11. came
    Stockmar who brought me the unwelcome news of poor Lord Melbourne’s
    continued indisposition and total incapability of coming to see me
    to-day, which I regret for two reasons: first because I have many
    things to ask him, 2ndly because I like very much to talk to him, as he
    is so quiet in what he says....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 12th July.</i>—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted.
    Did various things. At ½ p. 10 came Stockmar and stayed for some time.
    At ½ p. 11 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 12. He looked and
    said he was better, but not quite well. Dressed. At a little before
    2 I went with Mamma and the Duchess of Sutherland (in my carriage),
    Charles and Mary and Lady Tavistock and Lord Albemarle (in the next
    carriage), and Lady Mary Stopford and Colonel Cavendish in another. I
    was in full dress and wore the Order of the Bath. I went in state with
    a large escort. I was received at the door by the Lord Chamberlain,
    the Lord Steward, &amp;c., &amp;c., and was by them conducted into the Closet,
    where some people kissed hands. I then went into the Throne Room, Lord
    Conyngham handing me in, and a Page of Honour (Master Ellice) bearing
    my train. I sat on the Throne. Mamma and Mary stood on the steps of the
    Throne on one side, and the Duchess of Sutherland and Lady Tavistock
    stood near me (behind). I then received the two Addresses (of which, as
    also of all the other things, I subjoin an account), and read Answers
    to both. I then returned to the Closet; and went into another room to
    put on the Mantle of the Bath<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> (of crimson satin lined with white
    silk); I then saw Lord Melbourne in the Closet for a few minutes.
    After this I went again into the Throne-room, and seated myself on the
    Throne. I then conferred the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>Order of the Bath (<em>not sitting</em> of
    course) upon Prince Esterhazy. After this I again went into the Closet.
    Mamma, Mary, Charles and Lady Mary Stopford then went home; it was 3
    o’clock. I then took off my Mantle. Received two Deputations from the
    Sheriffs &amp;c., to ask when I would receive two more Addresses from the
    City. My two Ladies attended me, but after this they went into another
    room, where they remained till I went. I then gave an Audience to Lord
    Lansdowne. After this I held a Privy Council. After the Council I gave
    audiences to the Earl of Yarborough<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> (who thanked me very much for
    having appointed his amiable daughter, Lady Charlotte Copley, one of my
    Bedchamber Women); to Lord Melbourne, Lord John Russell, Lord Mulgrave,
    and Lord Hill. I then left the Palace, the Duchess of Sutherland (who
    looked lovely, as she always does), and Lady Tavistock, going with me
    in my carriage, in the same way as I came, and got home at a ¼ to 5....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 13th July.</i>—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. It
    was the <em>last time</em> that I slept in this poor old Palace,<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a>
    as I go into Buckingham Palace today. Though I rejoice to <em>go</em>
    into B.P. for many reasons, it is not without feelings of regret <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>that
    I shall bid adieu <em>for ever</em> (that is to say <em>for ever</em>
    as a <span class="smcap">dwelling</span>), to this my birth-place, where I have been
    born and bred, and to which I am really attached! I have seen my dear
    sister married here, I have seen many of my dear relations here, I
    have had pleasant balls and <em>delicious</em> concerts here, my present
    rooms upstairs are really very pleasant, comfortable and pretty, and
    <i>enfin</i> I like this poor Palace. I have held my first Council here
    too! I have gone through painful and disagreeable scenes here, ’tis
    true, but still I am fond of the poor old Palace. Lord Melbourne told
    me yesterday that the Hon. Miss Dillon<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> (to whom I had offered
    it), has accepted the situation of Maid of Honour. I always saw Lord
    Melbourne and also Stockmar in my Private Sitting-room (the first of
    the three), but all the other Ministers &amp;c. &amp;c. I saw in the further
    room (the farthest of the 3). Did various things. Saw Stockmar for some
    time. The poor rooms look so sad and deserted, everything being taken
    away. Wrote my journal. At a little after 2 I went with Mamma and Lady
    Lansdowne (in my carriage), Lehzen, and Col. Cavendish (in the next)
    to Buckingham Palace. I am much pleased with my rooms.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> They are
    high, pleasant and cheerful. Arranged things. At a little after 4 Lady
    Lansdowne brought Miss Pitt<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> and Miss Spring Rice<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> (the two
    Maids of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>Honour in Waiting, and who lodge here) to kiss hands. Miss
    Pitt is a <em>very</em> pretty, elegant, nice girl, and Miss Spring Rice
    is a nice, clever-looking girl. Saw Stockmar. Lady Lansdowne afterwards
    brought Miss Davys to kiss hands, who is a very nice girl (though not
    at all pretty). I then walked round the garden (which is large and very
    pretty) with Mamma. Dear <em>Dashy</em> was quite happy in it....</p>

  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> break between the life of Princess Victoria and that of the
      young Queen was now complete. Changes came innumerable and fast.
      Her Household was formed, and it reflected the complexion of Lord
      Melbourne’s Ministry, which had been established in power after
      the General Election by a majority of thirty-eight. The Queen left
      the home of her childhood for ever. She was the first Sovereign to
      occupy Buckingham Palace. The building had been begun by George
      IV., and although finished by William IV., had never been prepared
      for occupation. It remained an inconvenient house until it was
      added to in after-years by Prince Albert. Although Baron Stockmar,
      the old medical attendant of King Leopold, who had been domiciled
      in England by command of his master, was reputed to be acting as
      the Queen’s Private Secretary, that post was in reality occupied
      by Lord Melbourne himself. He was both Private Secretary and Tutor
      to the young Queen at this stage of her career. Her political
      education proceeded fast, and she learned with avidity. Her good
      sense and composure were indeed remarkable. It was noted by all
      that she was considerate and thoughtful to her elderly relatives,
      and to the friends and servants of her predecessor. Her girlish
      charm was attractive to those who were privileged to be about her,
      and its influence over her subjects was soon widespread. When
      within a month of her accession she appeared in the House of Lords
      to dissolve Parliament in accordance with the Law, she read her
      Speech, said Fanny Kemble, who was present, with splendid effect.
      This well-qualified judge observed that the Queen’s voice was
      exquisite, that her enunciation was as perfect as the intonation
      was melodious, and that it was impossible to hear more excellent
      utterance than that of the Queen’s English by the English Queen.</p>

    <p>It is difficult always to remember that the writer of these
      Journals was at this epoch little more than a child, that she
      had been educated almost exclusively by women, and that she had
      lived on the whole a very solitary life, hampered by the unhappy
      conditions attached to a girl who possesses no brothers and
      sisters, and is in addition heir to a Throne. She was now suddenly
      thrown almost entirely among men, grave and old, all of whom were
      engaged in administering the complicated affairs of that Kingdom of
      which she was Queen. It is difficult to imagine a greater contrast.
      How rapidly the youthful Princess became a woman under the pressure
      of these extraordinary circumstances becomes clear from her
      Journals. They indicate a curious maturity, through which, however,
      there peeps occasionally the face and figure of a child.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER VII<br>1837</div>

  <p><i>Friday, 14th July.</i>—Got up after 8. At ½ p. 9 I, Mamma, Lehzen,
    and Lady Flora breakfasted upstairs. Wrote, signed, &amp;c. Saw Sir F.
    Watson, Col. Cavendish, Sir H. Wheatley, Stockmar. At a little after 11
    saw Sir John Hobhouse<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> for a little while. He is a very clever and
    agreeable man. I saw him (where I shall see all the Ministers &amp;c.) in
    the small room<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> which opens into my sitting-room. Wrote my journal.
    Dressed. At a few minutes to 2 I went with Mamma and the Duchess of
    Sutherland (in my carriage), Lady Charlemont and Lord Albemarle (in the
    next carriage), and Charles, Mary, and Lady Flora (in the other) to St.
    James’s. I was in full dress and wore the blue ribbon and star of the
    Garter, and the Garter round my arm. I was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>received in the same way as
    before. I went into the Throne Room, sat on the Throne, and received
    three Addresses in the same way as on Friday. Two of the Addresses were
    <em>very fully</em> attended and the room became intensely hot. I then
    put on the Mantle and Collar of the Garter (of dark blue velvet lined
    with white silk). Gave a few minutes audience to Lord Melbourne. I then
    went into the Throne Room (did not sit on the Throne), held a Chapter
    of the Garter and conferred that Order on Charles. Mamma, Charles and
    Mary went away immediately after this, but I remained and gave a long
    audience to Lord Melbourne, who read to me the Speech which I am to
    deliver when I prorogue Parliament. He reads so well and with <em>so</em>
    much good feeling. I am sorry to see him still looking ill. I then saw
    the Duke of Devonshire.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> Came home with my two Ladies at ½ p. 4.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 15th July.</i>—At a few minutes p. 2 I went into one of
    the large drawing-rooms and held a Cabinet Council, at which were
    present all the Ministers. The Council lasted but a very short while. I
    then went into my Closet and received Lord Melbourne there. He stayed
    with me till 20 minutes to 4. He seemed and said he was better. He has
    such an honest, frank, and yet gentle manner. He talks so quietly. I
    always feel peculiarly satisfied when I have talked with him. I have
    <em>great</em> confidence in him. Saw the Duke of Argyll<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and Lord
    Albemarle. At 10 minutes to 4 came Lord Palmerston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span> and stayed about
    20 minutes. He is a very clever and agreeable man. I then saw Lord
    Glenelg for a short while. Played and sang. Wrote my journal. At a ¼
    to 8 I dined. Mamma being unwell did not come to dinner. Besides the
    people in the House which made with me 6,—Charles, Mary, the Duke of
    Sussex, Princess Sophia, the Duke of Norfolk, the Earl and Countess of
    Mulgrave, the Earl and Countess of Durham, the Earl of Liverpool and
    the Ladies Jenkinson, the Lord and the Equerry in Waiting, and Lord
    John Churchill<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> dined here. I sat between Uncle Sussex and the Duke
    of Norfolk. After dinner, at 10 o’clock came <em>Thalberg</em>,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> the
    most famous pianist in the world! He played four things, all by heart.
    They were all Fantasias by him; (1) on <cite>The Preghiera of Mosé</cite>,
    (2) on “God save the King” and “Rule Britannia,” (3) on <cite>Norma</cite>,
    (4) on <cite>Les Huguenots</cite>. <em>Never, never</em> did I hear anything at
    all like him! He combines the most <em>exquisite</em>, <em>delicate</em>
    and touching feeling with the most wonderful and powerful execution!
    He is unique and I am quite in ecstasies and raptures with him. I sat
    quite near the piano and it is quite extraordinary to watch his hands,
    which are large, but fine and graceful. He draws tones and sounds from
    the piano which no one else can do. He is <em>unique</em>. He is quite
    young, about 25, small, delicate-looking, a very pleasing countenance,
    and extremely gentlemanlike. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>He is modest to a degree and very
    agreeable to talk to. J’étais en extase!...</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 17th July.</i>—Got up at 8. At ½ p. 9 we breakfasted. Saw
    Sir F. Watson and Col. Cavendish. Saw Stockmar. At ½ p. 1 I went
    in state to the House of Lords, with the Duchess of Sutherland and
    the Master of the Horse in my carriage, and Lady Lansdowne and Lady
    Mulgrave in another. Had I time I would give a very minute account
    of the whole, but as I have <em>very</em> little, I will only say what
    I feel I wish particularly to name. I went first to the Robing-room,
    but as there were so many people there I went to a Dressing-room where
    I put on the Robe which is enormously heavy. After this I entered
    the House of Lords preceded by all the Officers of State and Lord
    Melbourne bearing the Sword of State walking just before me. He stood
    quite close to me on the left-hand of the Throne, and I feel always a
    satisfaction to have him near me on such occasions, as he is such an
    honest, good, kind-hearted man and is my <em>friend</em>, I know it. The
    Lord Chancellor stood on my left. The house was very full and I felt
    somewhat (but very little) nervous before I read my speech, but it
    did very well, and I was happy to hear people were satisfied. I then
    unrobed in the Library and came home as I went, at 20 minutes p. 3....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 19th July.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8. At ½ p. 9 we
    breakfasted. Saw Sir F. Watson, Col. Cavendish, and Stockmar. At 20
    minutes p. 11 came Lord Melbourne till a ¼ p. 12. Talked over many
    things. Dressed. At a ¼ p. 1 I went with the Duchess of Sutherland and
    Lady Portman in my carriage, to St. James’s. I received two addresses
    on the Throne and read answers to them. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>After that Col. Buckley<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
    and Col. Wemyss kissed hands on being appointed Equerries, as also the
    Hon. William Cowper (nephew to Lord Melbourne) as Groom in Waiting.
    Also many others. I gave audiences to various foreign Ambassadors,
    amongst which were Count Orloff,<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> sent by the Emperor of Russia
    to compliment me. He presented me with a letter from the Empress of
    Russia accompanied by the Order of St. Catherine all set in diamonds.
    (I, of course, as I generally do every evening, wore the Garter.) The
    Levee began immediately after this and lasted till ½ p. 4 without one
    minute’s interruption. I had my hand kissed nearly <em>3000</em> times!
    I then held a Council, at which were present almost all the Ministers.
    After this I saw Lord Melbourne for a little while, and then Lord
    Palmerston....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 2nd August.</i>— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa
    with the pretty amiable little Countess C. Pozzo di Borgo and Lady
    Salisbury,<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and Count Pozzo di Borgo and Prince Auersperg<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
    sat near us. Prince Auersperg is a very nice, good-looking young man,
    very quiet, good-humoured and retiring. Lady Seymour is certainly
    <em>exceedingly</em> beautiful; she has not the splendid eyes and
    fine expression of her sister Mrs. Norton, but altogether she is
    handsomest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> and there is a sweetness and gentleness about her which
    neither Mrs. Norton nor Mrs. Blackwood have.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Stayed up till ½ p.
    10....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 9th August.</i>—Got up at a little after 8 and
    breakfasted at ½ p. 9. Saw Sir Frederic Watson and Col. Buckley.
    Began a letter to dear Uncle Leopold. Saw Stockmar. Finished my
    letter to Uncle Leopold and wrote my journal. At 7 minutes to 12 came
    Lord Melbourne and stayed till a ¼ to 2. Talked over many serious
    subjects. I’m somewhat anxious about the Elections but I trust in
    Heaven that we shall have a Majority for us, and that the present
    Government may remain firm for <em>long</em>. Lord Melbourne spoke so
    candidly, so disinterestedly, and so calmly about all this. Wrote my
    journal. Drew. At 3 came the Queen Adelaide’s sister, Ida, Duchess of
    Saxe-Weimar,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> with 3 of her children. Her 2nd son, Edward, 14 years
    old, who was born here<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> and consequently is my subject, and her
    little girls, Anna and Amalie, 9 and 7 years old. Edward is a very nice
    boy. I stayed some time with them and then went down and drew in my
    room while Mamma took them into the garden....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 15th August.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8, and breakfasted in my
    own room at a ¼ to 10. Put on my habit and went with dear Lehzen,
    Miss Cavendish,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> Lord Albemarle, Col. Cavendish, Col. Buckley and
    Stockmar, to the Mews, which are in the garden. The Riding-house is
    very large. Sir George Quentin and Mr. Fozard (who has a situation in
    my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>Stables) &amp;c., were there. I had not ridden for 2 years! I first
    rode a bay horse, a delightful one called Ottoman, and cantered about
    a good while. I then tried for a minute another horse which I did not
    like so well. I then remounted Ottoman. After him I mounted a beautiful
    and very powerful but delightful grey horse, a Hanoverian, called
    Fearon. Miss Cavendish rode also the whole time; she rides very nicely.
    Came home at 20 minutes to 12. Mamma came into the School when I had
    been riding a little while....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 16th August.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8, and breakfasted before
    10 in my own room. At ½ p. 10 I went to the Riding House with Mamma,
    Miss Cocks,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Miss Cavendish, dearest Lehzen, Col. Cavendish, and
    Col. Buckley. I rode 1st a horse called Rosa (not my poor little Rosa),
    then Monarch, rather a nice horse, then Emma, not a bad horse, then
    Fearon, my favourite, and lastly Emperor, a <em>very</em> nice chestnut
    horse. Mamma and my Maids of Honour also rode. Came home at 12. At 7
    minutes past 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed till a ¼ to 3....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Windsor Castle</span>, <i>Tuesday, 22nd August</i>.—Got up at a ¼ to
    9 and breakfasted at 10. Saw Col. Buckley. Wrote to the Grand Duchess
    of Oldenbourg.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Arranged various things. At 20 minutes to 12 came
    my kind, good friend Lord Melbourne and stayed till ½ p. 1. I am quite
    sorry to think I shall not see him till next Monday, when he comes down
    to me at Windsor, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>for I am so fond of him, and his conversations do
    me much good; he is such a thoroughly straightforward, disinterested,
    excellent and kindhearted man. He goes down to Brocket Hall tonight
    with his sister Lady Cowper, Lady Fanny, and Mr. Cowper (my Groom), and
    the younger brother, Spencer Cowper. I hope the country air and rest
    will do him good. Saw Sir H. Wheatley, and Stockmar. Wrote my journal.
    Saw Sir F. Wetherall,<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> and Prince Ernest of Hesse P.B.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> At ½
    p. 2 I went with Mamma, Lady Charlotte Copley, and Lady Flora in my
    carriage; dear Lehzen, Miss Cocks, Miss Cavendish, and Col. Buckley
    going in the other, to Windsor Castle, where I arrived at ½ p. 5. I had
    escort of Lancers. All along the road the people were very loyal and
    civil, and my poor native place, Kensington, particularly so. When we
    reached the Long Walk at Windsor a larger escort of the 1st Life Guards
    met me; the Walk was thronged with people, where a dinner was given to
    them in honour of my arrival. The people were remarkably friendly and
    civil. Unfortunately it began to rain before we reached the Long Walk.
    Windsor looked somewhat gloomy and I cannot help feeling as though
    <em>I</em> was not the Mistress of the House and as if I was to see the
    poor King and Queen. There is sadness about the whole which I must say
    I feel. Lady Tavistock, who is in waiting for 4 weeks, Lord Conyngham,
    and the Lord Steward received me at the door. I inhabit the Queen’s
    rooms, though not in the same way as she did. At ½ p. 7 we dined....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 26th August.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at 10 we
    breakfasted with all the Ladies including Lady Charlemont and Lady
    Barham. To-day is my <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span><em>dearest</em> cousin Albert’s 18th birthday, and
    I pray Heaven to pour its choicest blessings on his beloved head! Took
    leave of Lady Barham as both she and he go away....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 27th August.</i>— ... At ½ p. 2 we all went into the
    drawing-room and received the King of Würtemburg<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> who came to take
    leave. He was accompanied by Count Mandelsloh, Baron Spitzemberg, and
    General Fleischmann. He took luncheon with us and the whole party
    including Lord Glenelg, whom I asked to stay another night. By some
    mistake Lord Tavistock did not come to luncheon. I sat between the King
    and Count Mandelsloh. After luncheon I showed the King the State Rooms
    &amp;c. and at 4 he took leave and went away. He leaves England on Tuesday
    and is much pleased with what he has seen....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 28th August.</i>— ... I hope Lord Melbourne will stay here
    for some days. At 4 I rode out with Mamma, Lady Charlotte Copley, Lady
    Mary Stopford (who got into the carriage and drove), Miss Cavendish,
    Miss Cocks, Lord Melbourne, Lord Conyngham, Lord Torrington,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
    Col. Cavendish, Col. Buckley, and Mr. Rich. As Sir George Quentin and
    Mr. Fozard <em>always</em> ride out with us, I shall not mention them
    any more. Lady Tavistock and Lehzen followed in a pony carriage. I
    rode Duchess, a nice bay horse, but rather too quiet and not near so
    pleasant as Monarch. Mamma rode Barbara. Lord Melbourne rode his own
    horse, a very fine black mare which came down from London this day. It
    was a very pleasant ride and we came home at a ¼ p. 6.... <span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span><em>Tuesday,
    29th August.</em>—Got up at ½ p. 8 and at ½ p. 9 we breakfasted with
    all the ladies. Wrote my journal. At ½ p. 11 or rather at a ¼ to 12
    came Lord Melbourne and stayed till a ¼ to 2. At 3 I walked over the
    House with Mamma and most of the ladies, and Lord Conyngham, Col.
    Buckley, Col. Cavendish, &amp;c. The offices are not good. We then walked
    a little while on the Terrace. Played on the piano or rather more
    sang with Mamma. At 7 o’clock arrived my <em>dearest most beloved</em>
    Uncle Leopold and my <em>dearest most beloved</em> Aunt Louise. They
    <em>are both</em>, and <em>look both</em>, <em>very well</em>; dearest Aunt
    Louise is looking so well and is grown <em>quite</em> fat. I and Mamma
    as well as my whole court were all at the door to receive them. It is
    an inexpressible <em>happiness</em> and <em>joy</em> to me, to have these
    dearest beloved relations with me and in <em>my own</em> house. I took
    them to their rooms, and then hastened to dress for dinner. At 8 we
    dined.... Dearest Aunt Louise went in first with Lord Lansdowne, then
    I with dear Uncle, and Mamma with M. Van de Weyer. I sat between dear
    Uncle and my good Lord Melbourne; two delightful neighbours. Dear Aunt
    Louise sat opposite. After dinner I sat on the sofa with dearest Aunt
    Louise, who is really <em>an angel</em>, and Lord Melbourne sat near me.
    Uncle talked with Lord Palmerston. It was a most delightful evening....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 1st September.</i>— ... I rode Monarch who went
    delightfully, and Aunt Louise and Mamma the same horses as the
    preceding day. The weather looked lowering when we went out. When
    we were about the middle of Queen Anne’s Walk, there came a most
    unexpected and violent flash of lightning which was followed
    instantaneously by a tremendous clap of thunder. My horse jumped a
    little, but very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>little, but Aunt Louise’s being very much alarmed by
    the thunder, <em>ran away, full gallop</em>, to our great horror, and
    poor dear Aunt lost her hat; thank God! the horse stopped after 100
    yards at the foot of a hill and was led back. We had meanwhile got into
    a close carriage with the three ladies, and dear Aunt Louise who was
    not the <em>least</em> frightened but only “quite ashamed” as she said,
    also got in, and we drove home (all six) in a tremendous thunderstorm
    and deluge of rain. We reached home in perfect safety at 5 o’clock....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 8th September.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at a little before
    10 I breakfasted with dearest Uncle Leopold, dearest Aunt Louise,
    Mamma and the Duke of Sussex. Talked with Uncle Leopold for some time.
    How I wish I had time to take <em>minutes</em> of the very interesting
    and highly important conversations I have with my Uncle and with Lord
    Melbourne; the sound observations they make, and the impartial advice
    they give me would make a most interesting book. At 11 Lord Melbourne
    came to me and stayed with me till 20 minutes to 1. He is a most
    excellent, kindhearted, honest and upright man, and my beloved Uncle
    is delighted with him, which makes me very happy, as I am so fond of
    Lord Melbourne, and he <em>has been</em> and <em>is such</em> a <em>kind
    friend</em> to me. Uncle and he perfectly agree in Politics too, which
    are the <em>best</em> there <em>are</em>. Lord Melbourne goes to town, I’m
    sorry to say, today, but will be back here tomorrow. Saw dearest Uncle
    Leopold. Talked with him. Signed. Wrote my journal....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 12th September.</i>— ... After dinner I sat part of the
    evening on the sofa with Lady Tavistock, dearest Uncle Leopold and Lord
    Melbourne sitting near me; they talked very interestingly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>together.
    The rest of the evening I sat on the sofa with dearest Aunt Louise, who
    played a game at chess with me, to <em>teach</em> me, and Lord Melbourne
    sat near me. Lord Tavistock, Lord Palmerston, Mrs. Cavendish, Sir J.
    Hobhouse and Mme. de Mérode,<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> sat round the table. Lord Melbourne,
    Lord Palmerston, Sir J. Hobhouse, and later too Lord Conyngham, all
    gave me advice, and <em>all different</em> advice, about my playing at
    chess, and <em>all</em> got so <em>eager</em> that it was very amusing;
    in particular Lord Palmerston and Sir J. Hobhouse,<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> who differed
    totally and got quite excited and serious about it. Between them
    all, I got quite beat, and Aunt Louise triumphed over my Council of
    Ministers!...</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 18th September.</i>— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa
    part of the evening with Lady Tavistock, Lord Melbourne sitting near
    me, and the rest with my <em>dearest</em> Aunt Louise, with whom I
    played a game at chess, and <em>beat</em> her; Lord Palmerston, Lord
    Melbourne, and Lord Conyngham sat near me advising me. At 11, our
    <em>last happy evening</em> broke up, and Aunt Louise took leave in
    the kindest way imaginable of the whole party except my gentlemen;
    and good Lord Melbourne was touched to tears by this leave-taking.
    I cannot say <em>how</em> I shall miss my dearest Aunt Louise; she
    combines with <em>great</em> cleverness and learning, so much merriment,
    and has all the liveliness and fun of a girl of 16, with all the
    <em>sense</em> and <em>deep</em> thought of one of 30 and much older even.
    And I think <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>she is <em>so lovely</em>, so graceful, she has such an
    angelic expression in her clear eyes; and she dresses <em>so well</em>,
    morning and evening. And then my beloved Uncle whom I look up to and
    <em>love</em> as a <em>father</em>, how I shall <em>miss</em> his protection
    out <em>riding</em>, and his conversation!...</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 28th September.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 8 and breakfasted
    with Mamma at a ¼ to 10. Wrote to the Duchess of Gloucester. Saw Sir
    Jeffrey Wyattville.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Wrote to the Queen and my journal. At 12 Lord
    Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till 10 m. p. 1. Dressed, in a
    habit of dark blue with red collar and cuffs (the Windsor Uniform which
    all my gentlemen wear), a military cap, and my Order of the Garter, as
    I was going to review the Troops. At 2 I mounted Leopold, who was very
    handsomely harnessed; all the gentlemen were in uniform, that is to say
    Lord Hill, Lord Alfred Paget<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> (who looked remarkably handsome in
    his uniform of the Blues), Prince Lichtenstein,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Baron Reisehach,
    &amp;c., and my other gentlemen wore the Windsor uniform with cocked hats.
    Mamma and Miss Cavendish rode, as did also my pretty little page,
    George Cavendish, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>who looked so pretty in his uniform, mounted on a
    little pony all harnessed like a large horse. Lord Palmerston also
    rode. All the other ladies and gentlemen, including Lord Melbourne,
    drove in carriages after us. The Lancers escorted us. When we came upon
    the ground, which is in the Home Park, I rode up with the whole party
    to where a Sergeant was stationed with the colours, and there stopped,
    and the regiments saluted me. I saluted them by putting my hand to my
    cap like the officers do, and was much admired for my manner of doing
    so. I then cantered up to the Lines with all the gentlemen and rode
    along them. Leopold behaved most beautifully, so quietly, the Bands
    really playing <em>in</em> his face. I then cantered back to my first
    position and there remained while the Troops marched by in slow and
    quick time, and when they manœuvred, which they did beautifully. The
    Troops consisted of the 1st Regiment of Life Guards who are beautiful,
    of the Grenadier Guards, and of some of the Lancers. They fired and
    skirmished a good deal, and near us, and Leopold never moved. The whole
    went off beautifully; and I felt for the first time like a man, as if
    I could fight myself at the head of my Troops. We rode back to the
    Castle at ½ p. 4, and I mounted Barbara and rode out with Mamma, Prince
    Lichtenstein, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Baron Reisehach, Lord
    Torrington, Lord Alfred Paget, Miss Cavendish, Lady Mary, Mr. Murray
    and Miss Murray, and came home at 7 m. to 6. Lord Melbourne rode near me.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 29th September.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at 10
    with Mamma. Wrote to dear Ferdinand and to the good Queen of Portugal
    while my hair was doing before breakfast. Wrote to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>dearest Aunt Louise
    and my journal. At 12 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till
    ½ p. 1. He read to me a Paper about the Civil List, and explained it
    to me, and so <em>clearly</em> and <em>well</em> he explained it; he reads
    very well too, so distinctly and with so much good emphasis....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 30th September.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at
    10 with Mamma. Saw Lord Albemarle. Wrote my journal. At a ¼ p. 11 Lord
    Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till a ¼ to 12. At a ¼ to 12
    came the Queen with her sister the Duchess of Saxe-Weimar and stayed
    with me till 1 o’clock. The poor Queen was very much composed, though
    it must have been a very painful and severe trial for her, considering
    she had not been here since she left the Castle, the night after the
    poor King’s funeral. I showed her all my rooms with which she was much
    pleased; and she went by herself to see the room where the King died. I
    sang a little and Mamma also, while they were there....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 3rd October.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and at a ¼ p. 10 I
    breakfasted with Mamma. Wrote to dearest Uncle Leopold and my journal.
    Saw Sir H. Wheatley. At ½ p. 12 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed
    with me till 5 m. to 2. He read to me some Despatches from Canada
    which are not very satisfactory. Saw Princess Augusta. At ½ p. 3 I
    rode out with Mamma, Lord Melbourne, Lord Palmerston, Lady Mary, Lord
    Torrington, Mr. Murray, Mr. Brand, Col., Mrs. and Miss Cavendish, and
    Miss Murray, and came home at 6. We rode all round Virginia Water, a
    beautiful ride, and cantered almost the whole way home. It was the
    hottest summer evening that can be imagined, not a breath of air, and
    hotter coming home than going out. Alas! it <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>was our last ride here! I
    am <em>very sorry</em> indeed to go! I passed such a very pleasant time
    here; the pleasantest summer I <span class="smcap">ever</span> passed in <em>my life</em>,
    and I shall never forget this first summer of my Reign. I have had the
    <em>great</em> happiness of having my beloved Uncle and Aunt here with
    me, I have had very pleasant people and kind friends staying with me,
    and I have had <em>delicious</em> rides which have done me a world of
    good. Lord Melbourne rode near me the whole time. The more I see of him
    and the more I know of him, the more I like and appreciate his fine and
    honest character. I have seen a great deal of him, every day, these
    last 5 weeks, and I have always found him in good humour, kind, good,
    and most agreeable; I have seen him in my Closet for Political Affairs,
    I have ridden out with him (every day), I have sat near him constantly
    at and after dinner, and talked about all sorts of things, and have
    always found him a kind and most excellent and very agreeable man. I am
    very fond of him. Wrote my journal....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Brighton</span>, <i>Wednesday, 4th October</i>.—... I constantly
    regret I cannot write down many of the pleasant and instructive
    conversations I have with clever people, such as Lord Melbourne, Lord
    Palmerston, Lord Holland, &amp;c., &amp;c. And many of the Foreign Despatches
    which I read, in particular some of the Private letters of the
    Ambassadors and Ministers to Lord Palmerston, are <em>so</em> interesting
    and well written that I wish I could note them down. I read one of Mr.
    Villiers’<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> from Madrid to-day, which is remarkably well written....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 24th October.</i>—Got up at 25 m. p. 8 and breakfasted at
    a ¼ to 10 with Mamma, having signed &amp;c. before breakfast. Wrote my
    journal &amp;c. At 3 m. to 11 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with
    me till ½ p. 12. Talked over many things and gave him a letter I had
    received this morning from Uncle Leopold, to read; he took it with him.
    Sat to Sir David Wilkie. Before I left the painting room, I sent for
    Lord Melbourne to see the Picture, with which he was much pleased. It
    is to be my <em>First Council</em>,<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> and a great many Portraits will
    be introduced into the picture; Lord Melbourne will be painted standing
    near me. Wrote my journal....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 29th October.</i>— ... At a little after 3 I <em>tried</em>
    to drive out with Lady Mulgrave, Lady Gardiner and Miss Paget<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
    following, but we were obliged to come home again almost directly as it
    rained the whole time. It is really most provoking weather. Finished
    my letter to Feodore, and wrote one to my <em>Cousin Marie</em>.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
    Saw Stockmar for one instant. At 7 we dined....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 1st November.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted at 10 with Mamma.
    Received before breakfast a letter from Ferdinand and one from Mary
    with a very pretty little ring in it. At ½ p. 10 my excellent, kind
    friend Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till 12. Talked
    over many things; and talked over some <em>disagreeable business</em>
    about which Lord Melbourne is <em>very kind</em> (as he is about
    <em>everything</em>, for he is the best-hearted, kindest and most feeling
    man in the world) and very anxious. Showed him dear Ferdinand’s letter.
    Poor Ferdinand’s position and the unfortunate state of Portuguese
    affairs distress him much; he takes everything so much to heart,
    which is generally not the case with a Statesman. I observed to Lord
    Melbourne that there were not many very good preachers to be found; he
    replied in the affirmative and added, “But there are not <em>many very
    good anything</em>,” which is <em>very true</em>.... I then took leave
    of him, told him I was very sorry he went, to which he replied he was
    also very sorry. I shall see him again however on Saturday when I go
    to town. I am <em>very sorry</em> to lose his agreeable company (as I
    always like to have those who are kind to me, and <em>my</em> friends,
    with me) these last days here. And I am very sorry to think that the
    summer and autumn (the pleasantest <em>I</em> <span class="smcap">ever</span> passed) are
    over! How time flies when pleasantly spent!! Lord Melbourne also was
    much better for this quiet life and liked it too. He is a great friend
    of Lehzen’s which makes me <em>more</em> fond of him still. I always saw
    Lord Melbourne in my little sitting-room; I being seated on a sofa, and
    he in an armchair near or close opposite me; the other ministers and
    visitors I saw in another little room just the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>size as this one,
    where Lehzen always sits; it is close to the other, one little room
    only being between the two....</p>

  <p><span class="smcap">Buckingham Palace</span>, <i>Saturday, 4th November</i>.—Got up at ½
    p. 7. Wrote my journal while my hair was doing. Received a few lines
    from Lord Melbourne. At 9 I breakfasted with Mama. Saw Stockmar. At 10
    minutes to 10 I left Brighton with Mama and Lady Mulgrave; Miss Dillon,
    Lady Mary Stopford, dearest Lehzen and Col. Cavendish following in
    another carriage. Lady Gardiner went in her own carriage. I took leave
    of Miss Paget before I went; both her and Miss Dillon’s waitings were
    out on Thursday, but I did not wish to give the other Maids of Honour
    the trouble of coming down only for two days and then going back again.
    Miss Paget is a very good, quiet, nice, unaffected girl. We changed
    horses first at Hickstead, 2ndly at Crawley, 3rdly at Redhill, and
    lastly at Croydon, and reached Buckingham Palace at 3. It is a journey
    of 52 miles.... I have changed my rooms, that is to say, I sit in my
    dressing-room, and make it both my sitting and dressing-room, which is
    much more comfortable and cheerful than the other rooms on the other
    side; and I shall see all my Ministers &amp;c. in the former breakfast
    room,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> next my dressing-room, which is now very prettily furnished
    and looks very nice and cheerful. Lehzen’s little sitting-room is next
    this room. At a few m. p. 4 came my good Lord Melbourne, whom I was
    happy to see well and in good spirits, though a little tired with the
    deal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>he has to do; he stayed with me till 10 m. p. 5, and we talked
    over various important things. I, of course, saw him in the <em>new
    Ministerial Room</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 9th November.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 9 and breakfasted by
    myself in my room at ½ p. 10. Played on the piano and sang. Wrote my
    journal. Dressed for the Lord Mayor’s dinner, in <em>all my finery</em>.
    At 2 I went in the state carriage and 8 horses with the Duchess
    of Sutherland and Lord Albemarle; all my suite, the Royal Family,
    &amp;c., went before me. I reached the Guildhall at a little before 4.
    Throughout my progress to the city, I met with the <span class="smcap">most</span>
    gratifying, affectionate, hearty and brilliant reception from the
    greatest concourse of people I ever witnessed; the streets being
    <em>immensely crowded</em> as were also the windows, houses, churches,
    balconies, every where. I was then conducted by the Lord Chamberlain,
    the Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress preceding me, and my whole suite
    following me,—to a private drawing-room, where I found Mamma, the
    Duchess of Gloucester, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Augusta, and all
    their Ladies. All my Ladies came in there. After waiting some little
    time, I sent for Lord Melbourne and Lord John Russell, to ask them some
    questions, and they came in for a minute or two, and then went away.
    After waiting a little longer, I was conducted by Lord Conyngham in
    the same way as before, the Royal Family and my Ladies &amp;c. following,
    to the Council Room, where were the Dukes of Sussex and Cambridge and
    George,—all my Ministers, all the Foreign Ambassadors and Ministers
    &amp;c., &amp;c., the Lord Mayor, all the Aldermen, the Lady Mayoress and
    all the Aldermen’s wives. I was seated in a large arm-chair, all the
    others standing. The Recorder then read an Address, to which I read an
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>answer; when the Lord Mayor was presented I said to Lord John Russell
    (what I had previously been told to do), “I desire you to take proper
    measures for conferring the dignity of Baronet on the Lord Mayor.” I
    then knighted the Sheriffs, one of whom was Mr. Montefiore, a Jew, an
    excellent man<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>; and I was very glad that I was the first to do what
    <em>I</em> think quite right, as it should be. The Lady Mayoress and all
    the Aldermen’s wives were then presented. After this we returned, as
    before, to the Private Drawing room and remained there till a ¼ p. 5
    when we went to dinner.... I drank a glass of wine with the Lord Mayor
    (John Cowan) and the late Lord Mayor. The Lord Mayor is a quiet little
    old man of 70 (they say). When my health was given out, there was
    great cheering and applause. I left dinner in the same way I came in
    at about ½ p. 7; and we went as before into the Private Drawing room
    and waited there till the carriages were ready. All the Royal Family
    went away before me. I went at ½ p. 8 in a usual carriage (not a state
    carriage) with the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord Albemarle as before.
    We came back just in the same way as we went, only that each carriage
    had only a pair of horses, and there were no people on foot walking by
    the carriage. The crowd was, if possible, greater than it had been when
    I went in the day; and they cheered me excessively as I came along. The
    streets <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>were beautifully illuminated on all sides, and looked very
    brilliant and gay. I got home by 20 m. to 10, and quite safely; I trust
    there have been no accidents. I cannot say <span class="smcap">how</span> gratified, and
    <span class="smcap">how</span> <em>touched</em> I am by the very brilliant, affectionate,
    cordial, enthusiastic and <em>unanimous</em> reception I met with in
    this the <em>greatest</em> Metropolis in the <em>World</em>; there was not
    a discontented look, not a sign of displeasure—all loyalty, affection
    and loud greeting from the immense multitude I passed through; and no
    disorder whatever. I feel <em>deeply grateful</em> for this display of
    affection and unfeigned loyalty and <em>attachment</em> from my good
    people. It is much more than I deserve, and I shall do my utmost to
    render myself worthy of all this love and affection. I had a very bad
    headache in the morning, but it went off during all the ceremonies; it
    was somewhat bad when I came home, but I went to bed immediately after
    I had signed a few papers....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 12th November.</i>— ... Saw Stockmar. Walked. Signed. Wrote
    my journal. Read Despatches. At a little after 7 we dined. Our whole
    party made only 12 in number, which were, us 10 (for Miss Davys and
    Col. Cavendish had gone home and Lady Mary was ill), Lord Melbourne
    and Mr. Cowper. Lord Melbourne led me in and I sat between him and Mr.
    Cowper. I was happy to see Lord Melbourne in very good spirits; he was
    very amusing about Theatricals and has peculiar tastes of his own about
    actors. He has such an honest, blunt, and amusing manner of coming out
    with his remarks and observations. After dinner I sat on the sofa with
    Mamma, and Lord Melbourne sat near me the whole evening. Mr. Cowper
    (who, as usual, was very amusing), and Lady Mulgrave sat near the
    table. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>Lord Melbourne does not, I think, look quite as well as he used
    to do when at Windsor and Brighton; he looks paler and tired often; and
    he says he feels the want of exercise. I fear since I have come to the
    throne he has still more to do than he had before; but he is always
    ready to assist me in every way, and will not admit that I trouble him.
    Stayed up till 11. It was a very pleasant evening.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 13th November.</i>— ... I do not mention when I get
    communications from Lord Melbourne and when I write to him, for that
    occurs <em>every</em> day and <em>generally</em> 2 or 3 times a day, so
    that it would take up too much time; I also receive communications
    from all the other Ministers; the one with whom I communicate
    <em>oftenest</em> after Lord Melbourne is Lord Palmerston....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 16th November.</i>— ... At a ¼ p. 2 Lord Melbourne came
    to me and stayed with me till 12 m. p. 3. He read me the Speech again,
    as it is settled to be now; and became touched to tears in reading the
    concluding part which alludes to my youth and reliance on the Loyalty
    of my People—kind, excellent, good man. Talked over various things....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 17th November.</i>— ... After dinner I went at ½ p. 6 with
    all the dinner party, except Lehzen (who again went with Mr. Rich to
    the play in a box opposite), Miss Davys (who did not go), and Lord
    Alfred Paget (who was on the escort and rode by the carriage), to the
    play to Covent Garden, the Duchess of Sutherland and Lord Albemarle
    going with me in the carriage. I met with the same brilliant reception,
    the house being <em>so</em> full that there was a great piece of work
    for want of room, and many people had to be <em>pulled</em> out of the
    Pit by their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>wrists and arms into the Dress Circle. I never saw such
    an exhibition; it was the oddest thing I ever saw. My Ladies took it
    by turns, (their standing behind me, I mean). Mamma sat near me, and
    Lady Mary stood behind her. The performances were the fine but dreadful
    tragedy of <cite>Werner</cite> by Lord Byron, and the 1st act of <cite>Fra
    Diavolo</cite>....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 20th November.</i>—Got up at a ¼ to 9 and breakfasted
    by myself at a ¼ p. 10. Played on the piano. Saw Mr. Spring Rice.
    Dressed for going to the House of Lords, exactly in the same costume
    as last July. When I was dressed I saw the Duchess of Gloucester,
    the Duchess of Cambridge, and Augusta<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and little Mary.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> At
    ½ p. 1 I went in the State Carriage with the Duchess of Sutherland
    and Lord Albemarle; Lady Lansdowne, Lady Barham, and all my gentlemen
    (except Lord Conyngham who went as a Peer and not in my suite), and
    3 Pages, going in 6 other carriages, to the House of Lords to open
    Parliament. I arrived there at 2, and was conducted to the Library—all
    the Great Officers of State, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President,
    the Lord Privy Seal, preceding me—Lord Melbourne walking quite close
    before me bearing the sword of state. I robed in the Library, all the
    above-mentioned people, my ladies and gentlemen, being there, and then
    proceeded into the House of Lords—the manner of going in being the same
    as before—and seated myself on the Throne; Lord Melbourne standing
    quite close to me on my left; I feel a satisfaction in having this
    excellent man near me on such important public occasions. I read the
    Declaration about Transubstantiation, or rather repeated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span> it after the
    Chancellor—the Commons having been summoned to the Bar. After this I
    read the Speech (which I think an excellent one) and which people were
    pleased to say I read well. The House was very full. I then returned
    to the Library and unrobed. Good, kind Melbourne was quite touched to
    tears after I read the Speech. I could only say a very few words to
    him. I came home, as I went, at a ¼ p. 3. Lehzen was at the House,
    which I am very glad of, and <em>she</em> was pleased with my manner....
    The Duke of Sussex was the mover of the Address in the House of Lords,
    and made a very able and judicious speech, Lord Melbourne wrote me
    word. I got Lord Melbourne’s despatch while I was at dinner, and I left
    the table for a minute to read it. Lord Melbourne likewise informed me
    that “the Address was voted without a dissentient voice”; and that the
    Duke of Wellington spoke fairly; adhering to his declaration of last
    Session, and saying that the manner in which the Measures for Ireland
    were mentioned in the Speech would facilitate his intention to support
    Ministers in their measures. None of the Ministers spoke. I hail this
    bright and unanimous beginning as an auspicious augury of the coming
    Session and I trust that all will do well....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 24th November.</i>— ... Saw Lord Conyngham and Edwin
    Landseer, who brought a beautiful little sketch which he has done this
    morning, of a picture he is to paint for me of Hector and Dash. He is
    an unassuming, pleasing and very young-looking man, with fair hair. At
    1 Lord Melbourne came to me and stayed with me till a ¼ to 2. Talked
    over various things....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 28th November.</i>— ... At 20 m. to 1 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>came Lord Melbourne
    and stayed with me till 2. I was glad to see him looking well and in
    high spirits. He said it was “a very good debate” in the House of
    Lords; that the Duke of Wellington had been somewhat eager but had
    been put down. The House sat till p. 11, and Lord Melbourne only got
    his dinner then. I showed him Lord John’s account of the Debate in
    the H. of Commons. He said there was a good deal in this <em>large</em>
    majority as the Opposition had made rather a point of it to carry
    it. Lord Melbourne was quite touched in saying this, as he knows
    how anxious I am the Government should be <em>firm</em> for the peace
    of the Country and for my own peace and happiness; as also when he
    spoke of the readiness with which the Civil List would be voted. He
    is <em>so</em> kind to me; I have the <span class="smcap">greatest</span> confidence in
    him. He is so truly excellent. I cannot say <span class="smcap">how</span> happy I am at
    this <em>good</em> beginning! Lord Melbourne even said, everything went
    much better than they expected. I trust most fervently that all will
    continue thus well....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 29th November.</i>— ... At 20 m. p. 12 Lord Melbourne
    came to me and stayed with me till 2. He told me there had been a very
    short debate upon the Duke of Newcastle’s<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> bringing in a Bill for
    the Repeal of the Catholic Emancipation Act (a most absurd idea). He
    (the Duke of Newcastle) was only supported by Lord Lorton<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> and
    Lord Winchilsea. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>Lord Melbourne and Lord Brougham spoke. I read the
    speech of the former (Lord Melbourne) in the papers; it is, as all
    his speeches and sayings are, remarkably judicious and clever....
    At ½ p. 7 we dined.... I sat between the Duke of Wellington and the
    Marquis Conyngham. The former I thought looking very old, and silent
    and out of spirits. I think he does not feel <i>à son aise dans sa
    position</i>; he fears to displease his friends and does not wish to
    oppose the Ministry violently.... I sat on the sofa with Lady Mulgrave
    and Lady Barham; Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> and Lady Caroline
    Strangways<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> sitting near me. Lady Wilhelmina is not so handsome as
    she was; she is not to be compared, in <em>my</em> opinion, to Lady Fanny
    Cowper, whose great charm, besides her lovely face, fine complexion
    and beautiful figure is her great quietness, and unaffected manners,
    and unconsciousness of her beauty. Lady Wilhelmina is nevertheless an
    agreeable, clever girl....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 4th December.</i>—Got up at ½ p. 9.... At about 10 m. to
    1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 2. Talked about many
    things, and amongst others about the Pensions which give so much
    trouble. Lord Melbourne said he thought it “quite an abomination to
    meddle with the pensions” which people now had; that upon the whole,
    hereafter, he was rather against giving pensions, for he said, “if
    people know that you have the power to grant them, they apply without
    end, and it is very difficult to refuse”; “it requires,” he added,
    “nerves of <em>iron</em> to refuse,” and “if you have none <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>to give away,
    why there is an end of it.” I think this is all very true....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 6th December.</i>—At 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed
    with me till a ¼ p. 2. He told me that there was a good deal of
    speaking in the House of Lords yesterday, upon the 2nd reading of the
    Imprisonment for Debt Bill, and that they sat till 10 o’clock. The
    bill, though opposed in detail, by some, was read a 2nd time, and
    was referred to a Committee. In the House of Commons, the Municipal
    Corporation Bill for Ireland was introduced without opposition. There
    was some debate upon an affair of the dismissal of a Col. Verner in
    Ireland (which was done, as Lord Melbourne told me at Windsor, against
    his (Lord M.’s) wish, and which he still dislikes, but which cannot be
    helped now), on account of a toast he gave at a public dinner. Lord
    Morpeth quite put him (Col. Verner) down, by “a triumphant speech,”
    as Lord John wrote me word; I always shew these reports of Lord John
    to Lord Melbourne.... Lord Melbourne led me in, and I sat between
    him and Lord Canning, who is exceedingly shy. Lord Melbourne was in
    good spirits and we talked a good deal upon various subjects; I made
    him laugh very much by telling him what the Duchess of Sutherland
    told me <em>he</em> had told <em>her</em> about Lord Brougham’s speech
    on education, which was: “That it was tiresome to hear, tiresome to
    educate, and tiresome to be educated.” He said, “I think it is very
    true....”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 7th December.</i>—Went into the Drawing room where Mr.
    Landseer showed me two <em>most</em> beautiful pictures, done by himself,
    one large, the other small, which he had brought for me to see; the
    figures and animals are all most beautifully <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>painted and grouped;
    and most exquisitely finished, so that I looked at them through a
    <em>magnifying glass</em>; I never saw anything so exquisite in every
    way. He also showed me a sketch in oils (small) of Lord Melbourne which
    is like, but too fat, and though flattered is not in my opinion half
    pleasing enough. It is very well done; he also showed me a sketch of
    Mrs. Lister done in <em>one</em> sitting, and exceedingly pretty. He had
    only had two sittings of Lord Melbourne. He certainly is the cleverest
    artist there is. Sat to Mr. Hayter for a long while. Showed him some
    of my drawings which he praised and told me where they were in fault.
    Drew. Tried to sketch little Mary Barrington while her mother amused
    her....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 8th December.</i>— ... After dinner I sat on the sofa with
    Lady Ashley,<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> who was very agreeable and talked to me of her
    children &amp;c. One of her charms is her being so natural. Lord Melbourne
    sat near me the whole evening. He talked to me about the play, about
    Joan of Arc, whom he admires, and said, “It is clearly proved that
    what she did is not to be attributed to any impropriety of conduct.”
    Many historians have chosen to blemish the character of this poor,
    innocent maid, who was <em>so</em> great. He asked me if I had ever read
    Barante’s <cite>History of the Princes of the House of Burgundy</cite>, in
    8 vols., which gives a whole account of Joan; which I have not. M. de
    Barente is French Ambassador at St. Petersburg. Lord Melbourne also
    spoke to me of Lord Ashley, who he says is a very good <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>man; and less
    eager in Politics than he was; Lord Ashley is a high Tory. He “adores”
    Lady Ashley, Lord Melbourne says. Lord Melbourne also told me that
    when I first came to the Throne, Lord Ashley “wrote to Emily” (Lady
    Cowper) “and said, ‘Why, it’s shocking that Lord Melbourne has only put
    Whig ladies about the Queen’; upon which Lady Cowper said, ‘Why, Lady
    Barham is not such a great Whig’; ‘Oh!’ said Ashley, ‘<em>she</em> is
    quite terrible, <em>she</em> is the worst of all.’” This amused me much.
    There is no end to the amusing anecdotes and stories Lord Melbourne
    tells, and he tells them all in such an amusing funny way. Spoke to me
    about horses; he told me his pretty black mare is rather crippled by
    his having travelled her about so much, and that she must get rest.
    Lady Ashley says that Lady Cowper dotes upon her grandchildren and
    would give them and let them do anything. Stayed up till 11. It was a
    <em>very</em> pleasant evening.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 9th December.</i>— ... I forgot to say that Lord Melbourne
    got a letter after dinner from Mr. Cowper (which he showed me) from
    the House of Commons, in which he said, “The Debate is going in our
    favour.” Lord Melbourne spoke to me about several of the speakers in
    the House of Commons; spoke of Sir E. Sugden<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> whom he says is a
    very clever lawyer, and said, “His father was a hair-cutter; he cut
    my hair very often.” This is a singular thing. Told me of an affront
    which the “Demagogue Hunt”<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> offered William Peel one day, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>in
    the House of Commons, on the latter’s attacking him. William Peel
    said something derogatory about Hunt’s extraction, upon which Hunt
    replied: “If <em>my</em> father was the <em>first gentleman</em> of his
    family, <em>your</em> father was the <em>last gentleman</em> of <em>his</em>
    family....”</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 12th December.</i>— ... Lord Melbourne, though looking
    pale, I was happy to see in very good spirits. A few minutes after
    we had sat down, he turned to me and said, “We have had a great
    <em>set-to</em> in the House of Lords.” He added that Lord Brougham<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a>
    had made an unexpected opposition against the Message which Lord
    Melbourne read in my name the day before, pressing my increase of
    income for my Mother. Lord Duncannon told me that Lord Brougham had
    lately taken to making cutting attacks against my Ministers, and that
    he had most unhandsomely attacked my excellent Lord Melbourne, called
    him “a Courtier,” &amp;c., &amp;c., which, no wonder, roused Lord Melbourne’s
    temper, and that he returned it Lord Brougham most admirably. He
    always speaks well, but particularly well this time, Lord Duncannon
    said. I turned to Lord Melbourne and said I had heard he had spoken so
    well, “as you always do,” I added. But he is so modest and backward
    about his own extraordinary merits. He said to me, there might be a
    like difficulty in the H. of Commons upon this Message. Spoke to me
    about many other things and about boys at school, and told me a very
    amusing anecdote about himself. He and Lady Mulgrave were saying how
    imprudent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>it was to tell children things which they might not repeat.
    So he said, “When I was a boy of ten, and came home, my Mother was
    asking me about the boys at school, and I mentioned who were there, and
    amongst others the present Lord Boston.<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> My Mother said ‘Oh! every
    Irby is a fool,’ which is very true; so, when I went back to school,
    I told this, and said, ‘My Mother says every Irby is a fool.’ This
    was repeated, and written back to Lord Boston,<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> and created most
    dreadful offence.” We then spoke about Magnetism, which every body is
    mad about now; and I said it was very disagreeable to be magnetised,
    as people got to say such odd things in this <em>magnetic</em> state.
    “Why,” said Lord Melbourne, “people say odd enough things without being
    magnetised....” Spoke of Lord and Lady Ashley, their happiness and
    fondness for each other. I spoke to him of Lady C. Barrington’s<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
    gratitude to me, at which his eyes filled with tears. He is the
    kindest, best, and tenderest hearted man I know; he is so truly
    excellent, and moral, and has such a strong feeling against immorality
    and wickedness; and he is <em>so</em> truly kind to me....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 22nd December.</i>— ... Lord Melbourne spoke to me a good
    deal about the Privy Purse, about its expenses, the Pensions on it,
    &amp;c., &amp;c. About the Household Expenditure; about many other things
    concerning expenditure; about the late Kings, George 4th and William
    4th’s fancies, &amp;c., &amp;c. His ideas about all these things are so
    reasonable and so excellent.... I sat between <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>Lord Melbourne (who
    led me in) and Lord Palmerston. I was delighted to see Lord Melbourne
    in excellent spirits, and looking much better. He was very clever and
    funny about education, at dinner; his ideas are excellent about it,
    I think. He said that he thought almost every body’s character was
    formed by their Mother, and that if the children did not turn out well,
    the mothers should be punished for it. I daresay <em>his</em> noble,
    fine and excellent character was formed by his mother,<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> for she
    was a remarkably clever and sensible woman. He told me that the Civil
    List Bill was read a third time that evening, without any opposition.
    The news are, I grieve to say, very bad from Canada<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>; that is to
    say rumours and reports by the Papers, though we have no Official
    Reports. But Lord <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>Melbourne hopes that it may not be so bad as it is
    rumoured. There certainly is open Rebellion. This makes it expedient
    that Parliament should meet again on the 16th January and not adjourn
    <em>till</em> the 1st Feb. as was at first intended....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 26th December.</i>— ... At 3 I left Buckingham Palace (with
    regret, as I had passed a pleasant time there), with Mamma and Lady
    Mulgrave; Lady Mary, Miss Cocks, Mrs. Campbell, Col. Grey,<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Lehzen,
    Miss Dillon, and Miss Davys following in 2 other carriages. We arrived
    at Windsor Castle at ½ p. 5. It was quite dark. The Castle looked very
    cheerful and comfortable, and I cannot say <em>how</em> much it put me in
    mind of last summer and of the <span class="smcap">very very happy</span> days I spent
    there....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 27th December.</i>— ... Besides our party of yesterday,
    the Duke and Duchess of Sutherland and the Duke of Argyll (who all
    stay here till Monday, 1st Jan.) dined here. The Duchess was looking
    so well; neither she nor the Duke have ever been staying at Windsor
    before and are delighted with the Castle. I sat between the Duke of
    Sutherland and Mr. Cowper. I talked a great deal with the latter, and a
    great deal about Lord Melbourne. He says that all the people who have
    never seen Lord Melbourne and come to have interviews with him, and
    those Members of the H. of Commons <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>who dine with him and have not seen
    or known him before and expect to find the Prime Minister a very proud,
    stiff person, are quite delighted with his very kind, unaffected,
    merry and open, frank manner, which I think everybody <em>must</em> and
    <em>ought</em> to be. He told me some amusing anecdotes about him, &amp;c.,
    &amp;c., and many other funny things. Lord Melbourne is very absent when in
    company, often, and talks to himself every now and then, loud enough to
    be heard but never loud enough to be understood. I am now, from habit,
    quite accustomed to it, but at first I turned round sometimes, thinking
    he was talking to me. Mr. Cowper says he does not think his uncle is
    aware of it; he says he is much less absent than he used to be....</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO CHAPTER VIII</h2>
  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> impression produced by the Queen at this time is vividly
      described by Princess Lieven in a letter to Lord Aberdeen. “I have
      seen the Queen twice,” she writes; “I have seen her alone, and I
      have seen her in Society with her Prime Minister. She possesses
      a composure, an air of command, and of dignity, which with her
      childlike face, her tiny figure, and her pretty smile, create
      one of the most extraordinary impressions that it is possible to
      imagine. She is extremely reserved in conversation. It is said that
      prudence is one of her highest qualities. Lord Melbourne adopts,
      when he is near her, an attitude of affection, of content, of
      self-consciousness mingled with a great deal of respect, which with
      his easy manners, the obvious habit of holding the first place amid
      her surroundings, his dreaminess at one moment, and his gaiety at
      another, make a picture you can easily realise. The Queen is full
      of amiability towards him.”</p>

    <p>That is a glimpse of the external setting in which these Journals
      were composed. Lord Melbourne never forgot, from the outset, that
      the girl to whom he was acting as guardian and tutor was the
      Sovereign of these Realms. His letters from the first are written
      in the conventional form of a Minister addressing the Sovereign.
      Although he obviously tried in conversation to amuse the Queen, and
      to impart to her youthful intelligence some knowledge of Society,
      and of the world of Affairs in which she was about to take part,
      he did not shrink from the graver topics of statecraft, and did
      not spare her the details of public matters that must have been
      difficult for her to grasp and comprehend.</p>

    <p>There is a passage in one of his letters, written about this time,
      in which he is explaining to the Queen the powers and duties which
      it was intended to transfer from the Secretary of State, who
      combined at that time the administration of Colonial and Military
      affairs, to a new Secretary of State for War. Lord Melbourne adds
      these words: “Your Majesty will not suppose that Lord Melbourne by
      laying before you the whole case has an idea of throwing the weight
      of such a decision entirely upon Your Majesty. Lord Melbourne will
      deem it his duty to offer to Your Majesty a decided opinion upon
      the subject.” This passage illuminates, if taken in conjunction
      with Princess Lieven’s descriptive passage, the atmosphere in
      which Lord Melbourne and the Queen were living at this time. To
      this young Queen he was Roger Ascham and Burleigh in one and <em>in
      petto</em>.</p>

  <div class="subhead">CHAPTER VIII<br>1838</div>

  <p><i>Monday, 1st January.</i>— ... The Duke of Sutherland told me the
    other night, that Lord Melbourne’s mother (whom he knew) was a very
    agreeable, sensible, clever woman, and that Lord Melbourne was very
    like her as to features; Lady Melbourne was very large latterly. Lord
    Melbourne’s father, on the contrary, the Duke said, was very far from
    agreeable or clever; he was a short fat man and not like any of his
    children. He died at the age of 80. The Duchess of Sutherland spoke to
    me last night about Lady Caroline Lamb,<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Lord Melbourne’s wife;
    she was Lord Duncannon’s only sister, and the strangest person that
    ever lived, really half crazy, and quite so when she died; she was not
    good-looking, but very clever, and could be very amusing. She teazed
    that excellent Lord Melbourne in every way, dreadfully, and quite
    embittered his life, which it ought to have been her pride to study
    to render a happy one; he was the kindest of husbands to her, and
    bore it most admirably; any other man would have separated from such
    a wife. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>He has now the greatest horror of any woman who is in any
    way eccentric or extravagant, which shows how very much he must have
    suffered from such a wife. The Duchess told me the strangest stories
    about her....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 2nd January.</i>— ... I rode a new horse, a most
    <em>delightful</em> creature, called Tartar; he is taller than Barbara,
    excessively pretty, and of a very dark brown colour; he has a very
    springy charming canter and action, is full of spirit, and yet as quiet
    as a lamb, never shies and is the best-tempered creature possible; to
    crown all these valuable qualities, Tartar is exceedingly sure-footed.
    It was a delightful ride and we cantered a great deal coming home; the
    roads were so dirty that my habit was quite heavy with mud. Changed my
    dress and walked out with Lady Mulgrave and Lehzen and came home at ½
    p. 3. Read Despatches from Canada which are very interesting....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 4th January.</i>— ... At ½ p. 5 came my excellent, kind
    friend, Lord Melbourne, whom I was quite delighted to see again after
    such a long absence, the longest that has taken place since I came
    to the Throne. I thought him in very good spirits, and looking well,
    though pale, and as kind, amiable and mild as ever; never do I find
    any difference in this excellent man, may he be very tired, or not
    tired, he is always equally kind and gentle, though he may at times be
    low. I was agreeably surprised to find him in good spirits, for from
    his letters and all the troubles and difficulties he has had of late,
    I feared it might not be so. He spoke to me first a good deal about
    Canada; said they were all agreed as to what was to be done, namely
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>to repeal a Statute (<em>which</em>, I cannot say), and <em>for</em>
    the present, govern as Canada had been governed before; but that
    Lord Howick was of a different opinion and thought that these strong
    measures ought to be accompanied by conciliatory measures, which Lord
    Melbourne said would not answer the purpose and have a bad effect; Lord
    Howick, he said, was excessively eager about this, for various reasons
    which Lord Melbourne explained to me; “if Lord Howick was to resign,”
    he added, “I do not think that would affect the Government; it would
    be a bad thing for there is a good deal of strength in him.” The other
    question, about the Army, he considered a more difficult one; the five
    Ministers who signed the Report relative to the changes meditated
    in the office of the Secretary of War, are, Lord John Russell, Lord
    Howick, Lord Palmerston, Sir J. Hobhouse, and Mr. Spring Rice. Lord
    Howick and Lord John, he said, are the only two who are eager about it;
    the others he believed signed it reluctantly, particularly Mr. Rice.
    We spoke a good deal about this difficult question; there is, in my
    opinion, a good deal for and a good deal against it. It is, as Lord
    Melbourne says, creating a new Minister with new powers, by giving the
    Secretary at War great power over the Army. There have been, as Lord
    Melbourne says, great abuses which it would be desirable to remedy.
    Spoke about the Troops to be sent to Canada; about Mr. Rice’s wish to
    take the Chair; about <em>his</em> reasons for doing so; how to replace
    <em>him</em>; about the present Speaker; about the quarrel in Belgium
    relative to the cutting of timber in the Grünewald; about the King of
    Hanover’s foolish proceedings; how they are viewed in Germany; about
    some despatches from Sir Frederick <span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>Lamb,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> saying that Metternich
    was much displeased at the expulsion of the Archbishop of Cologne, at
    the manner of doing it, and at the impolicy of the act. Lord Melbourne
    said he had dined once or twice at Lord Holland’s<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> since I had
    seen him. I was quite happy to talk to him again, as there were many
    subjects on which I wanted explanation and he explains <em>so</em> well
    and so clearly and agreeably.... My good Lord Melbourne led me in and I
    sat between him and Lord Torrington. He (Ld. M.) spoke to me about many
    things; about riding and horses; about <em>bad ears</em> for Music; said
    that everybody would suppose from Scott’s writings that he was very
    fond of and understood music very well; whereas Lord Melbourne said,
    <em>he</em> said: “In music I don’t know <em>high</em> from <em>low</em>!”...</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 9th January.</i>— ... At 22 m. to 12 came my excellent
    Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 27 m. p. 12. He had informed
    me by a note in the morning, that he should be obliged to go to
    London which I am extremely sorry for; Lord Glenelg wrote to him
    wishing to see him, and both he and Lord Glenelg were to see Lord
    Durham at <em>four</em> about this Canadian business. <em>I</em> shall
    say more of this hereafter. Lord Melbourne said: “It will <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>be a long
    interview, I dare say; probably last 2 hours, and there would be no
    time to be back,”—meaning for dinner tonight, so he will only come
    back at 4 tomorrow; I am <em>very</em> sorry to lose him <em>even</em> for
    <em>one</em> night. Spoke a good while about this. Spoke about this army
    business, upon which Lord Melbourne will see Lord Howick. He said,
    “It would be madness to propose at this moment a complete change in
    the Administration of the Army, when we have got all these affairs of
    Canada.” He spoke of this a good deal; and seemed to hope Lord Howick
    would give it up; he said the others would be ready to do so if he
    did.... Though I think Lord Duncannon agreeable and amusing, I cannot
    find in him or in any of the other Ministers, that kindness, mildness,
    and open frankness, and <em>agreeability</em> (to use a word of Lady
    Mary Stopford’s) which I find in my kind friend Lord Melbourne; <em>he
    alone</em> inspires me with that feeling of great confidence and I may
    say <em>security</em>, for I feel <em>so safe</em> when he speaks to me and
    is with me; what he says is all so kind and good, and he never says
    anything which could alarm or hurt me. But I should not <em>wish</em> to
    be on the same confidential footing with any of my other Ministers as I
    am with this truly excellent friend....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 10th January.</i>— ... Lord Melbourne said that he
    had seen Lord Durham who seemed very much inclined to accept the
    Proposition of going to Canada; he (Ld. D.) was not quite satisfied
    with all the plans proposed by Government, and particularly with a
    Council of 17, which he said was too many; that he could not manage
    more than 4 or 5. Lord Durham requires, Lord Melbourne added, a large
    outfit, as he would not spend any of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>his private fortune; and he
    would not go till the Navigation was open. Lord Melbourne then told
    me that he had seen Lord Howick who seemed “disposed to reconsider”
    the question of the army, and said he would not press parts of it, and
    would give way on some points. This is a great satisfaction and I think
    Lord Melbourne seemed quite happy about it....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 17th January.</i>— ... My excellent Lord Melbourne led me
    in, and I sat between him and Lord Glenelg. Lord Melbourne <em>said</em>
    he was, and I was happy to see he <em>looked</em>, better. He said, as
    he led me in, that the Majority in the House of Commons of the night
    before was very favourable. He spoke to me about Greece; said he had
    heard from his brother that they were very uneasy at Vienna about the
    state of Greece; said that the only person who showed any sense or
    character there was the Queen of Greece,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> but that she was very
    young and was placed in rather a rougher situation than suited her;
    that the Archduke John<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> had told Sir Frederic (on his return from
    Greece) “that she was like a Brazillian Paraquite in a wood of firs
    covered with snow,” meaning that she was in a position not suited to
    her; I said to Lord Melbourne that I had heard in the Summer that there
    were hopes of there being an <em>heir</em> in some time; he said, “I am
    afraid not.” He told me that the Archduke John had likewise told his
    brother that the Emperor of Russia<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> was beginning to sink under
    the immense weight and fatigue of governing such an empire as <span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>Russia;
    we spoke about him some time; and also a good deal about the Austrian
    Royal Family; Lord Melbourne told me that the Emperor of Austria<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
    was worse, and hardly able to do anything; but, that as his <em>mental
    faculties decreased</em>, his <em>bodily strength increased</em>. Spoke
    of Aunt Louise; of the Queen of Portugal; of Clementine, Augustus,
    &amp;c., of Feodore, her happiness, her not being rich; he spoke of the
    poverty of the younger branches in high families in England, and
    of their being often obliged to gain their livelihood in inferior
    situations; he said that he thought his nephew Lord Cowper was cleverer
    and had “a sounder understanding” than William Cowper.... Spoke about
    Shakespear’s plays; <cite>Hamlet</cite>, <cite>Macbeth</cite>, <cite>Lear</cite>, &amp;c.,
    &amp;c.; he thinks the 2 first named the finest; he said: “I think the
    German critics understand Shakespear better than we do here”; mentioned
    Goethe’s <cite>Wilhelm Meister</cite>, and Schlegel’s book upon Shakespear,
    which he thinks very good; he knew, or at least saw, Schlegel here;
    he knew Mme. de Staël; spoke of her, of her daughter, the Duchess de
    Broglie; spoke of actresses; of their marrying out of their sphere;
    of its often not answering; of Lady Harrington,<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Lady Craven<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
    (the Dowager), Lady Derby (the late),<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> Mrs. Butler; of marriages in
    <em>general</em>, and most cleverly and sensibly; of their often being
    broken off—the reasons why. Lord Melbourne said, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>“Why, you see, a
    gentleman hardly knows a girl till he has proposed, and then when he
    has an unrestrained intercourse with her he sees something and says,
    ‘This I don’t quite like....’”</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 19th January.</i>— ... The cold increases, the snow is
    getting deep, and I hear the Thames is frozen over very nearly, which
    has not happened since 1814. At ½ p. 1 came my excellent friend Lord
    Melbourne and stayed with me till 3. He looked well, I was very happy
    to see, and said he was not at all tired. He said that they had got
    through this Canada business very well; that Lord Brougham made a good
    though very violent speech; that the Duke of Wellington’s was very
    fair; in fact very friendly; that he (Lord Melbourne) thought the only
    difficult part to defend was the not having sent more troops; “but,” he
    added, “there the Duke of Wellington came to our assistance, and said
    there were not too few troops.” Spoke about Canada for some time....
    In speaking of the Duke of Wellington he said: “He has no oratorical
    powers; he attempts no ornament, but speaks generally very much to the
    point; he cannot always express what he feels and understands.” He
    added that people sometimes who were great in action could not express
    well in words what they meant and conceived; spoke of all the Duke’s
    family, and said he thought the Duke was the cleverest; asked me if I
    had ever read the Duke’s Despatches, and said they were worth looking
    at, to see the way he did them.... Lord Melbourne told me, in speaking
    of the Duke of Wellington, “His people are very angry with him; they
    think he is leaving them.” How wrong of these people! I told Lord
    Melbourne what my Uncle Leopold had written to me about him (Ld M.),
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>which seemed to please him. Talked of other things. Talked for some
    time with him and Lord Palmerston, about education, punishments, &amp;c.,
    Lord Melbourne was amazingly funny and amusing about this. I said I
    thought solitary confinement a good punishment: Lord Melbourne replied,
    “I think it’s a very stupefying punishment.” I mentioned the system of
    <em>silence</em> as a very good one and quoted myself as a proof of its
    having answered, which made them laugh very much. Lord Melbourne said,
    “It may do very well with a lively child; but with one of a sulky,
    <em>grumpy</em> disposition it would not answer....” I said I thought it
    cruel to punish children by depriving them of their meals and saying
    they should go without their supper, &amp;c. Lord Melbourne replied, “Why,
    when I was a child, they had contrived to annoy me so, and had made me
    cry so much, that I had lost all appetite.”</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 20th January.</i>— ... At ½ p. 12 Lord Glenelg presented
    Lord Durham to me on his appointment; Lord Glenelg then left the room
    and Lord Durham remained with me for about ½ an hour, I should say.
    He spoke entirely about Canada which subject he seems to understand
    thoroughly; said he considered the task he was about to undertake, a
    most difficult one; and he <em>might</em> not succeed; but that he would
    do his utmost to restore tranquillity in Canada; said he wished to
    have my authority, when the rebellion was quelled, to conciliate these
    deluded people and to hold out mercy to them. He spoke at much length
    about all this,—about what he intended to do,—the difficulty of the
    task, &amp;c., &amp;c. At ½ p. 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till
    20 m. p. 2. He seemed well. He said, “I am sorry to say I received a
    letter from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>Lord Howick this morning and that he makes a great demur
    about this Army affair.” Lord Melbourne then added that as it was such
    a difficult question and as it could be done “as it were by one blow,”
    and as the Army disliked it so much and altogether it was such a bad
    time for it, and he thought it such a difficult question, that he could
    not give way to him upon it, and could not advise me to do it; he added
    he would not mind it near so much if it were brought before Parliament
    and there fairly discussed, for then if it passed, it would be done
    by the authority of Parliament; but in this way, it was so entirely
    to be done by me, as it were, that he really could not agree to it;
    moreover that if even it were a very good thing in itself (which he
    does not think it), this would not be the moment for doing it; none
    of the other Ministers he thought were eager for it; but if it were
    proposed in the Cabinet and carried by a majority against Lord Howick,
    he (Ld. H.) might resign (which Lord M. says would be a bad thing, but
    would not affect the Government), and Lord Melbourne did not know what
    Lord John Russell might <em>then</em> do, if Lord Howick held out on it;
    which would then affect the Government. I told Lord Melbourne that if
    it could be of any use, he might say that <em>I quite</em> agreed with
    him (Lord Melbourne) and that he might rely upon me; which assurance
    pleased him, though I think he must long be aware of my firm resolution
    to support this kind and true friend of mine, as he truly and really
    is, in every way.... Got a few lines (when I went to my room) from Lord
    Melbourne (I generally <em>hear from</em> him and <em>write to him</em>
    every day, and very often <em>two</em> or <em>three</em> times a day), in
    which he said that great difference had prevailed and did <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>prevail in
    the Cabinet respecting the Details about Canada. A Cabinet had been
    held immediately after he left me. I am <em>very</em> sorry to hear this.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 21st January.</i>— ... After dinner before we sat down,
    I talked to Lord Melbourne about some important things; I asked him
    the cause of the differences in the Cabinet; he said that he wished,
    and also most of the others, that the Legislative Council in Canada
    should be chosen from those which composed the present Legislative
    Assembly,—whereas Lord Howick and some others wished the Council should
    be chosen from the Country at large, and not from the Assembly; Lord
    Melbourne was against this and for this reason; we should probably
    lose by such an Election many of the <em>English</em> party, now in the
    Legislative Assembly, and get a good many of the <em>French</em> party
    who would be hostile to us; and consequently diminish our influence;
    none of the other Ministers were as obstinately for this as Lord
    Howick—but he at length gave way.... He was very funny about a word
    which Lady Mary gave me to find out; she gave me the ivory letters
    and I was to find out the word; she gave me “thermometer,” and she
    spelt it with an “a” instead of an “e,” and laughed very much at her
    bad spelling; upon which Lord Melbourne said, “It is a very good way
    to spell it, but not <em>the</em> way,” which made us laugh. I said to
    him I was reading the first novel I had ever read—<cite>The Bride of
    Lammermoor</cite>; he said it was a very melancholy—a terrible story—but
    admires it; he mentioned <cite>Old Mortality</cite>, <cite>Quentin Durward</cite>,
    <cite>The Fair Maid of Perth</cite>, and <cite>Kenilworth</cite>, as Scott’s best
    novels; he said there was “a great deal of good” and “a great deal of
    bad” in his novels; said he admired <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>his poems very much, though most
    people said his novels were greatly superior in their way to his poems;
    spoke of Richard Cœur de Lion whom we both rather admire; of Henry IV.
    and Sully; Lord Melbourne said that Sully was a clever and good man,
    and greatly superior to those Ministers who followed him; Richelieu and
    Mazarin; “They were shocking fellows,” he added....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 23rd January.</i>— ... He spoke of what had just taken
    place in Canada; said Sir John Colborne<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> was an excellent officer.
    “A good officer,” he added, “can generally effect with a small force,
    what a bad officer with a large force would fail in.” Spoke about this
    question of the Army. Said that Lord Francis Egerton<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> had said in
    the House, “That the troops had done remarkably well and that he hoped
    nothing would be done to tamper with the management of the Army,”
    evidently alluding, Lord Melbourne observed, to the intended changes
    in the Army. I told Lord Melbourne that Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, on
    being told that I would continue to him and his brothers and sisters
    the same annual allowance they enjoyed from the late King, burst <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>into
    tears, and said it was unexpected, for they did not dare to hope for
    anything....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 24th January.</i>— ... Lady Falkland,<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> whom I had not
    yet seen, was of course presented to me by Lady Portman.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> I (as
    usual to all Peeresses and Ladies by courtesy) wished to kiss her, but
    she insisted on kissing my hand first and then only received her kiss
    from me.... I observed to Lord Melbourne that it must be a great trial
    for poor Lady Falkland dining here.... Lady Falkland must have felt
    very low, and it must have been a sad trial for her to see me for the
    1st time in the place of her poor father, but she behaved uncommonly
    well; she is a very nice person. She looked pale and thin, but still
    very pretty. I sat on the sofa with her; Lord Melbourne sitting near me
    the whole evening; and all the other ladies sitting round the table.
    Spoke with Lord Melbourne about Lady Falkland &amp;c. Asked him what he
    thought was the best History of the last 60 or 70 years. He said there
    was no History of that time <em>only</em>, but that it must be got
    from different books; that the <cite>Annual Register</cite> was as good a
    book as any, if I wanted to look for any particular event in any one
    year. That the beginning was written by Burke, and followed up by Dr.
    Laurence &amp;c. Said that being written at the time, it was tinctured
    with party spirit. He said Adolphus’s <cite>History of George III.</cite>
    was curious as he had got a good deal of information, and that the
    anecdotes told in it were true, though the <em>names</em> of the people
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>were sometimes wrong. Said that Hume’s <cite>History of England</cite> was
    undoubtedly the best, in spite of his party prejudices, and that he
    thought I would like it much better now than when I read it before.
    Spoke of Clarendon’s <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite> (which I told him
    I had read), which he thought curious, but likes his (Clarendon’s)
    <cite>Memoirs</cite> better. Spoke of Mrs. Hutchinson’s book, said I had
    been reading it; he thinks that “a nice book” and “very curious”; he
    knew the Editor of it; spoke of Charles the First, whom I thought
    much to blame.... Spoke of Sismondi, whom he thinks a dull writer;
    he recommends Barante’s <cite>History of the House of Burgundy</cite>; and
    Daru’s <cite>History of Venice</cite>; spoke of Voltaire’s Histories; of
    O’Driscol’s <cite>Ireland</cite> which he likes and whom he knew; of Scott’s
    <cite>History of Scotland</cite> which he has not read, &amp;c. &amp;c....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 25th January.</i>— ... At ½ p. 3 came my excellent Lord
    Melbourne and stayed with me till ½ p. 4. He said, “I think we have
    patched this up,” meaning the affair about the bill relating to Canada.
    “We mean to stand by the bill,” he added, “and take our chance of a
    division.” Lord John, he said, was very much for leaving the Preamble
    out, and was not at all pleased at being obliged to stand by it; and
    Lord Melbourne said it was a bad thing “to force a man to do what he
    dislikes when he has a principal part to act in it,” which is very
    true. He added something more about Canada and what was meant to be
    done, if they were beat about this clause. He said that Lord Howick’s
    great violence irritated the others on the other side (in the Cabinet);
    Mr. Thomson was very eager against Lord Howick’s ideas about Canada.
    I asked him if Mr. Poulett Thomson was eager; he replied that he was,
    but that he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>could control himself, which Lord Howick could not, and
    was excessively cross, and kept saying he would resign and would not
    be party to this and that, which offended the others.... Spoke of Sir
    Robert Peel, who I observed I thought was more eager than the Duke
    of Wellington. Lord Melbourne replied he was not acquainted with Sir
    Robert Peel’s character, could not judge of his feelings, did “not know
    if he was desirous of office or not.” Said he believed that his (the
    Duke’s) party were very angry with him for what he had said in the
    House of Lords, and therefore that Sir Robert was obliged to be more
    violent in order to keep his party together. “This I believe to be the
    truth,” Lord Melbourne observed....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 26th January.</i>— ... He told me that they had settled the
    matter about Canada. “We have settled to leave out the Preamble; Lord
    Howick has given way, and owned he was in the wrong.” He added: “It
    will be a triumph to the other party, but I don’t much mind that.” I
    said that I was surprised Lord Howick had given way. Lord Melbourne
    replied: “He is not devoid of candour,” but that his opinions were so
    very strong that he did not feel able to “surrender them.” Said that
    Sir Robert Peel had justly observed that: “what was the necessity of
    asking Parliament about what they <em>were going</em> to do”; “we don’t
    mean to oppose you; we won’t fetter you.” “Why therefore ask our
    approbation of what you are going to do?” “Act like any other Ministers
    and then afterwards we will approve or disapprove what has been
    done.”<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>“Now,” Lord Melbourne said, “this is almost unanswerable.”
    He is the fairest person about his opponents I ever knew; <em>so</em>
    frank, so noble! so candid!... Spoke of the Combinations of the workmen
    in Scotland and Ireland and England, which he says are quite frightful.
    This led him to speak of servants, of their combinations with
    tradespeople, their being bribed, &amp;c. He observed how disagreeable it
    was to recommend tradespeople or servants; he said that his coachmaker
    had come to him this morning and begged him to write a letter to
    the Bishop of Ely to recommend him to him. “Very well,” said Lord
    Melbourne, “I will write a letter if you wish which I will show you.”
    “So I wrote to the Bishop of Ely,” continued Lord Melbourne; “‘My dear
    Lord,—Mr. Robson has been my coachmaker for many years, and I believe
    him to be a very good one, but so he ought, for I must say he is a
    very dear one.’ ‘Now,’ I said to the man, ‘here is the letter, you may
    read it if you like....’” At 7 I went to Drury Lane with the Duchess
    of Sutherland, Lady Portman, Miss Cavendish, Lady Mary Stopford, Lord
    Conyngham, Lord Headfort, and Col. Buckley (who this day replaced
    Col. Grey). It was Shakespear’s tragedy of <cite>Hamlet</cite>, and we came
    in at the beginning of it. Mr. Charles Kean (son of old Kean) acted
    the part of Hamlet and I must say beautifully. His conception of this
    very difficult and I may almost say incomprehensible character, is
    admirable; his delivery of all the fine long speeches quite beautiful;
    he is excessively graceful and all his actions and attitudes are
    good, though not at all good-looking in face; the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>two finest scenes
    I thought were the <em>Play-scene</em>, which he acts, they say, quite
    differently to any other actor who has performed Hamlet; and the scene
    with his mother, the Queen; it was quite beautiful when he rushed out
    after having killed Polonius, exclaiming, “Is it the King?” He fights
    uncommonly well too. All the other characters were very badly acted.
    I came away just as <cite>Hamlet</cite> was over. They would recognise me
    between the 2nd and 3rd acts,—I was compelled to come forward, curtsey,
    and hear “God save the Queen” sung. The house was amazingly crowded and
    they received me admirably. Came home at ½ p. 10.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 27th January.</i>— ... Told Lord M. I had been much
    pleased with <cite>Hamlet</cite> last night; observed it was a very hard
    play to understand, which he agreed in; he said he thought the end of
    it “awkward” and horrid; said he thought Hamlet was supposed to be
    mad, of a philosophical mind, and urged to do something which he did
    not like to do. He added that Mr. Fox always said that <cite>Hamlet</cite>
    possessed more of Shakespear’s faults than almost any other play
    of Shakespear, &amp;c., &amp;c.—Saw Lord Palmerston who introduced Baron
    Munchausen, Minister from the Court of Hanover.... I told Ld. M. of
    my last recollection of Baron Munchausen,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> namely, my giving him
    a commission to send me some wax dolls from Berlin, which made Lord
    Melbourne laugh excessively. He spoke of children’s love for dolls,
    and that they sometimes think they are alive. Spoke of my former great
    love for dolls....<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span> After dinner, talked (before I sat down) with
    all the gentlemen, &amp;c. Spoke about Kean with Lord Melbourne; about
    Landseer and the sketches which Lord Melbourne saw and none of which he
    “thought <em>like</em>,” he said, though very clever.... Lord Melbourne
    said that <cite>Richard III.</cite> by Shakespear was a very fine play; I
    observed that Richard was a very bad man; Lord Melbourne also thinks
    he was a horrid man; he believes him to have been deformed (which some
    people deny), and thinks “there is no doubt that he murdered those
    two young Princes.” I was delighted to hear Lord Melbourne say he
    thought Henry 7th a very bad man, and reckless of blood; spoke of the
    inhuman <em>murder</em>, I may call it, of the young Earl of Warwick; he
    said that Ferdinand of Spain would not give his daughter Catherine to
    <em>Arthur</em> unless this poor Warwick was got rid of; that Catherine
    felt this all along and observed that it dwelt upon her and “that it
    did not go well with her in the world” for this reason. He spoke of
    Henry VIII.; said he was not so bad at first and had begun with good
    intentions; spoke of Catherine of Arragon, &amp;c., &amp;c.; that when Henry
    VIII. took a liking to somebody else, he only sought to get rid of the
    other in the quickest way. Spoke of the wars in Flanders.... He fell
    asleep for a little while in the evening, which is always a proof that
    he is not quite well....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 30th January.</i>— ... I asked Lord M. what Lord
    Palmerston’s Politics were at the time when he stood against Lord
    Lansdowne and Lord Althorp. Lord Melbourne said that Lord Palmerston
    then <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>belonged to the <em>high Tory</em> Party! Spoke of the change of
    opinions &amp;c., &amp;c. Spoke of the salaries &amp;c. of my people, and spoke of
    Names, Christian names, for a long while; said that Lady Vivian’s<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
    little girl was called <em>Lalage</em>, from Horace; he thought the name
    rather pretty on account of the lines which he repeated and which are,
    I <em>think</em>, “Dulce ridentem, Lalagen amabo, Dulce loquentem.” Told
    him of the intention there once was of changing my name, which he was
    surprised at, and could not think how it could have been done.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 1st February.</i>—The curious old form of pricking the
    Sheriffs was gone through; and I had to prick them all, with a huge
    pin. This was the first Council that I have yet held at which Lord
    Melbourne was not present, and I must say I felt sad not to see him
    in his place as I feel a peculiar satisfaction, nay I must own almost
    <em>security</em>, at seeing him present at these formal proceedings, as
    I know and feel that I have a <em>friend</em> near me, when I am as it
    were alone among so many strangers. This may sound almost childish, but
    it is not so. Saw Lord John Russell....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 3rd February.</i>—Received a communication from Lord
    Melbourne which I shall transcribe: “Lord Melbourne presents his humble
    duty to Your Majesty and acquaints Y.M. that the Canada Government
    Bill was read a second time in the House of Lords, with the single
    dissentient voice of Lord Brougham. Lord Melbourne sends the returns
    of the attendance and the speeches. Lord Brougham made a long and
    able speech, not over-violent for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>him. The Duke of Wellington made
    a moderate speech and concluded with some very able views” (I think)
    “of the subject. Lord Aberdeen and Lord Wharncliffe also spoke, both
    strongly condemning the conduct of Government.” This note was dated
    from last night. Heard also from Lord John Russell that they had
    proceeded in the House of Commons with the Irish Corporation Bill and
    the Pluralities Bill.... Lord M. said they sat till near 12 o’clock
    last night. Said “it was a very good Debate.” “The Duke of Wellington,”
    he added, “again made a very fair speech”; and that the Duke’s remarks
    were very good about Canada, for that there was a great deal to say
    about it; and that the Duke observed, “that each Mail brought the
    account of some new and very important event.” He (Ld. Melbourne) said
    that Lord Aberdeen and Lord Wharncliffe “were very severe.” I asked him
    if Lord Aberdeen was not rather a dull and heavy speaker; he replied
    in the affirmative; and said (in reply to my question as to whether he
    were a good speaker) that Lord Wharncliffe was a good speaker and spoke
    “very clearly.” I asked him about Lord Brougham’s speech which he said
    “was more bitter than violent; very bitter, but a fine speech.” Lord
    Melbourne told me: “We have not yet settled this Army Question; but I
    am more and more convinced it would be madness to propose it; and after
    this affair of Canada too.” He seemed, however, I thought, sanguine
    about its being ultimately settled.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 4th February.</i>—Lord Melbourne asked if I had seen <cite>King
    Lear</cite> (which I had half intended to do last week); I said I had
    not. He said (alluding to the manner in which it is being performed at
    Covent Garden), “It is <cite>King Lear</cite> as Shakespear <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>wrote it; and
    which has not been performed so, since the time of Queen Anne.” As it
    is generally acted, Lord Melbourne told me, it is altered by Cibber,
    who “put in a deal of stuff” of his own; that it was a much finer play
    as Shakespear wrote it, but “most dreadfully tragic.” That Dr. Johnson
    had seen it performed in that way, and that “it made such an impression
    on him that he never forgot it.” I observed to him that I feared that,
    and did not like all that madness on the stage. Lord Melbourne said,
    “I can’t bear that, but still it is a very fine play, and many think
    Shakespear’s best.” Spoke of the play of <cite>Richard III.</cite>, which I
    said I was going to see. Lord Melbourne said it was “a fine striking
    play.” He observed that that scene where Richard makes love to Anne,
    at the funeral of Henry VI., did not belong to the play, but was taken
    from <cite>Henry VI.</cite>; he said, “That is a very foolish scene; I always
    thought it a most ridiculous scene; and there is not the slightest
    foundation in History for it; he married her 8 years afterwards.” He
    added that Shakespear constantly mixed up events, in his Historical
    plays, without minding when they happened, and how far asunder.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 5th February.</i>—Lord M. showed me a letter he had got
    this morning, from Lord Ebrington,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> saying that Lord Tavistock
    (who, Lord Melbourne tells me, has great influence over Lord John,
    and was sent for) had prevailed on Lord John to put off the Army
    Question till June or July; so that Lord Melbourne says they will
    get over it this Session; and when a thing is put off, he added, it
    is often forgotten or the moment not found suitable for it. “But,”
    continued Lord Melbourne, “when one gets over one <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>difficulty, there
    always comes another; and there is now another question of great
    difficulty, which is the Ballot.” He then explained to me, that not
    only several of their supporters but even some of the Government had
    pledged themselves to the Ballot, and consequently after Lord John
    made that very decided declaration against the Ballot, these people
    said they must go against this; amongst others Sir Hussey Vivian who
    has pledged himself to it; and Lord Melbourne says if they should vote
    for it after Lord John’s declaration, either they or perhaps Lord
    John will resign, and this “would make such gaps in the Government as
    would make it very difficult to fill up; and Sir Hussey Vivian has
    written to Lord John this morning, and he to me, saying I shall have
    to choose whether I will accept Sir Hussey’s or his resignation.” Lord
    Melbourne however said he would see if he could manage it, which I
    fervently hope and trust he will; but he is sadly teazed and plagued.
    He said, “There is a succession of difficulties in a Government....” At
    20 m. to 7 I went with Lady Portman, Lady Tavistock, Miss Cavendish,
    Miss Pitt, Lord Conyngham, Lord Headfort, and Col. Buckley to Drury
    Lane theatre. We came in before the performance had commenced. It
    was Shakespear’s tragedy of <cite>Richard III.</cite>, and Charles Kean’s
    first appearance (in London) as Richard. The house was crammed to the
    ceiling; and the applause was tremendous when Kean came on; he was
    unable to make himself heard for at least five minutes I should say. He
    was dressed exactly like his father, and all those who were with me,
    and who had seen his father, were struck with the great resemblance
    to his father both in appearance and voice. It would be impossible
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>for me to attempt to describe the <em>admirable</em> manner in which
    Kean delineated the ferocious and fiend-like Richard. It was quite a
    <em>triumph</em> and the latter part particularly so; he was applauded
    throughout in the most enthusiastic manner. He acted with such spirit
    too! One of the best scenes was the one when the Lord Mayor urges him
    to accept the regal Dignity, which Kean did uncommonly well. As also
    the disagreeable and absurd scene with Lady Anne. The manner in which
    he gave: “So much for Buckingham,” was truly <em>splendid</em>, and
    called down thunders of applause, as also many other of the scenes
    where he gets very much excited; he fought and died beautifully. He was
    uncommonly well disguised, and looked very deformed and wicked. All the
    other parts were very badly acted, and the three women were <em>quite
    detestable</em>. It is a fine, heart-stirring play, and there are some
    beautiful passages in it. I but just escaped being recognised, for
    as the curtain was dropping and I left the box, they called out “the
    Queen.”</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 6th February.</i>—At 17 m. p. 2 came my kind friend Lord
    Melbourne who said he was better, and stayed with me till 20 m. p. 3.
    He spoke to me about Mr. Roebuck’s<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> speech of last night; said “it
    was a very bitter speech.” I told him what Lord John had written to
    me of what took place in the House of Commons last night. He spoke to
    me about this Parliamentary Elections Bill; said it would he thought
    not pass the House of Lords. Gave me an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>explanation about it, and
    about people’s being unable to vote unless they had paid the rates
    up to the very day; and that many people wanted to get rid of this;
    but the Lords did not like that as they thought it was “meddling with
    the Reform Bill.” I asked him if he had done anything more about the
    Ballot. He replied that he had heard from Lord John this morning, who
    said they had best wait the decision; he added that Lord John thinks
    he must resign if any of the others vote for the Ballot, as after his
    very strong declaration against it, he would consider their voting
    for it as “passing a censure upon him”; Lord Melbourne said he did
    not quite think that, and that he thought Lord John took it rather
    too seriously; but he added: “Lord John does.” Lord Melbourne said he
    thinks it better not to take much notice of who vote for or against
    it; and he added “we took no notice of it when Lord Charles Fitzroy
    voted for it (Ballot) last year; he is a very foolish man, I think.”
    I said to him that I believed the <em>Cabinet</em> were all agreed upon
    this question; he replied they were; “that is to say either to vote
    against its being made an open question, or not to vote at all.” He
    added that Sir John Hobhouse and Mr. Poulett Thomson did not vote at
    all, having he believed pledged themselves before they came into the
    Ministry.... Lord Melbourne told me he had dined at home the night
    before. Spoke to him about the play of <cite>Richard III.</cite>, and of
    Kean; spoke of Richard III. himself, who he (Ld. M.) believes to
    have been crooked and deformed, and to have murdered the two young
    Princes; though, he said, that great pains had been taken to trace it
    all in the <cite>Historical Doubts</cite> by Horace Walpole and to prove
    the contrary. He also mentioned the well-known <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>old story of the old
    Countess of Desmond,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> who “said she had danced with him” (Richard)
    “the night of his Coronation and that he was a very handsome man.”
    Spoke of the Duke of Wellington; he said “The Duke of Wellington is
    amazingly sensible to attention; nothing pleases him so much as if one
    asks him his opinion about anything.” He added that many people were
    offended with the Duke’s abrupt manner of speaking; I observed that I
    thought that was only a manner, and that he did not mean it so. “No
    more do I,” replied Lord Melbourne. Spoke of Lord Ebrington, who Lord
    Melbourne has known a long while and says is a clever man and possesses
    a considerable influence over Lord John; Lord Tavistock also he added,
    has influence over his brother John; “but,” said Lord Melbourne,
    “Lord Tavistock has also got some strange notions; he lives a great
    deal in the country; and people who live a great deal in the country
    pick up strange ideas.” I asked him if he thought there would be much
    opposition to the Irish Poor Laws in the House of Lords. “I think there
    will be none,” he said. “I don’t think there will be any difficulty
    about any of the <em>Questions</em>—it’s only this Ballot.” I asked him
    if he had seen Lord John about it. He replied that others had, but that
    “I don’t like to speak to him about it; I feel rather awkward about
    speaking to him about it, as last year he wanted me to make it an open
    question and I refused; and now <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>that I want him to relax he would say,
    ‘Why, what have you to say?’” He said Lord John was “very unbendable”
    about it. Lord Melbourne wanted him not to be so very particular
    about it, and let them vote for or against it (its being an open
    question) and not take much notice of it; but Lord John said that after
    <em>his</em> declaration <em>that</em> would <em>affect him</em>. I asked
    who were the others who wanted to vote for it. “Why, Sir Hussey Vivian
    is the one of the greatest consequence, and Parnell,”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> he replied.
    “The fact is, Vivian should not have pledged himself; he carried his
    election in a way he should not have done.”</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 7th February.</i>—Lord Melbourne said he had just been
    to see Lord Durham “who wants more force.” He (Ld. D.) said that
    the Duke of Wellington had told him he ought to have 75,000 men in
    Canada, to put it down. Lord Melbourne further told me that the Duke
    of Wellington had been to see Lord Durham on Friday, he thinks; stayed
    with him for an hour and a half; had gone with him through the whole
    thing, had told him how to manage the troops by sending them from one
    place to another, and told him all his ideas of doing the thing. Lord
    Melbourne seemed quite pleased about it.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> I showed Lord Melbourne
    a letter I had got from Stockmar, about which Lord Melbourne said he
    would write to Stockmar. Spoke about my asking Sir Robert Peel &amp;c. to
    dinner, which led us to speak about Lady Ashley, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>who, Lord Melbourne
    says, is decided in her politics, though not violent; she is a Tory;
    Lord Melbourne says she does not talk about it much; but he thinks she
    has at one time discussed it with her mother, who of course is a Whig;
    I said I supposed Lady Fanny had no ideas of her own about Politics; he
    replied, “Why I think she is a Tory.” I was surprised; said laughing I
    thought it very wrong, and very odd, as all her brothers were Whigs.
    Spoke to him at dinner about various things; he told me Mr. Roebuck
    is a small man with “small finely cut features,” and that he speaks
    well—“plainly, without ornament.”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 8th February.</i>—He said he thought there would be some
    debate in the H. of Lords about the third reading of the Canada bill
    tonight; he thinks Lord Ellenborough<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> will speak. I asked him if he
    (Ld. E.) was a clever man; he replied, “He is a disagreeable, conceited
    man, but a clever man....” Lord Melbourne told me today that when he
    was as young as Lord Canning is now, he “was very shy”; “I think I was
    about as shy as anybody could be,” he said.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 9th February.</i>—Got the following communication from
    Lord Melbourne. “The Canada Bill was read a third time yesterday
    evening without division, but after a Debate which lasted until ten
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>o’clock. Lord Ashburton<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> made a speech generally upon the subject
    of Colonies, Lord Mansfield<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> made an elaborate attack upon the
    Government and in some measure complained of the Duke of Wellington
    and Sir Robert Peel for not having taken more active measures in
    opposition, and Lord Brougham repeated the observations which he had
    before made, with no diminution of vehemence. The speakers were Lord
    Ellenborough, Lord Glenelg, Lord Ashburton, Lord Mansfield, Lord
    Lansdowne, Lord Brougham, Lord Melbourne, Lord Fitzwilliam,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a>
    who spoke with great kindness of the Government, but declared his
    disapprobation of the Bill.” I asked Lord Melbourne the other day how
    many Peers could constitute a House of Lords and be considered able to
    sit; he said <em>three</em>; and in the House of Commons 40 Members must
    be present to make a House of Commons. I likewise asked him if there
    was any particular form when a Peer takes his seat; he said <em>on his
    creation</em> there was a great deal of form; but on taking it in a new
    Parliament or upon succeeding to the Title there was hardly any. “You
    go up to the table,” he added, “take the oaths, pay the fees, and shake
    hands with the Chancellor.” Lord Melbourne also told me that any Peer
    may bring in any bill and lay it upon the table, and it is generally
    read a first time; whereas “in the H. of Commons, they must always move
    for leave to bring in a bill.” He said that Lord Ashburton had got that
    “fashionable theory” that it was better to give up the Colonies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>at
    once when they became at all unquiet; which Lord Melbourne observed
    with great justice, would be just the way to encourage them to revolt;
    for they would then say, “Why, we have nothing to do but to revolt to
    get rid of our masters.” And “a very dangerous thing to declare,” Lord
    Melbourne observed. Spoke a long time about all this; then about George
    IV., who he said was not at all unhappy at Princess Charlotte’s death,
    on the contrary, he was rather glad; spoke of her—of Uncle Leopold—her
    happiness with him—her death—that she might have been saved if she
    had not been so much weakened. I was delighted to see Lord Melbourne
    in very good spirits, and very talkative, and <em>so</em> agreeable!
    Spoke of many things; of M. de Barante, the French Ambassador at St.
    Petersburg who Lady Durham said she knew, as also his daughter who was
    separated from her husband and excited pity as he was known or supposed
    to have beat her. Upon this Lord Melbourne said: “Why, it is almost
    worth while for a woman to be beat, considering the exceeding pity she
    excites,” which made us laugh. Spoke of the dinner next day at the
    Lord Mayor’s, which Lord Melbourne said was called a private dinner of
    about 50 or 60 persons, and which was generally very dull. He spoke
    of the Duke of Wellington, and, with tears in his eyes at the Duke’s
    friendliness to Lord Durham, about Canada. I asked him if it would do
    well if I asked Lord and Lady Francis Egerton<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> the same day as the
    Duke of Wellington dined here; he replied extremely well, and that it
    would “be very agreeable to both.” I told him that I was very thankful
    to him when he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>told me <em>who</em> I should invite; he said, “I am
    afraid I don’t attend enough to that; I am rather neglectful about it,”
    which I would not allow. Spoke about the Emperor of Austria—the Duchess
    of Sutherland—her family; Lord Melbourne said she was naturally very
    proud; spoke about her house<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a>; the lease of which she wishes to
    buy, but which as it is Crown property Lord Melbourne said she could
    not do; he dreaded the time when the Duchess should learn she could
    not do so; that he was afraid of writing to her before she received
    the formal answer from the Treasury; I told him, however, it would
    be better if he did so, upon which he said: “Then it shall be done.”
    Spoke of Lady Ashley—Lady Hardwicke<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>—Lady Fanny; I asked him how
    she came to be a Tory—and who could have made her so. He said, “Why, I
    think her Nurse; people generally get their ideas in that way.” He told
    me he went to Eton when he was nine years old; he went there at Xmas
    in the year 1788, and stayed there till Midsummer 1796. Lord Holland
    left Eton about 3 months after Lord Melbourne went there. He spoke
    most cleverly and sensibly about Public Schools; said “I am not at all
    bigotted about a Public School”; said he was very happy at Eton; spoke
    of the many disadvantages and dangers of a Public School; amongst which
    he mentioned the great habit of telling falsehoods which boys get to
    do with impunity in order to save themselves from punishment; and the
    disagreeable, bad, blackguard boys you were obliged to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>meet at such
    schools; and if a boy is weak, the liability of being led and governed
    by such boys; Lady Durham likewise entered into the conversation, and
    she and Lord Melbourne and I went on discussing the subject for some
    time; Lady Durham observed that it was a constant <em>War</em> between
    boy and master at school, which however Lord Melbourne thought the same
    with a Tutor; we all agreed that it was very bad that no French was
    taught at the Public Schools, for that boys never learnt it afterwards.
    Lady Durham said that Lord Durham had had a great mind that their boy
    should learn no Latin at all, which however Lord Melbourne said he
    thought was a bad thing, for that he thought a man could not get on
    well in the world without Latin in the present state of society.<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a>
    I told Lord Melbourne that though Lehzen had often said that she had
    <em>never</em> seen such a passionate and naughty child as I was, still
    that I had never told a falsehood, though I knew I would be punished;
    Lord Melbourne said: “That is a fine character”; and I added that
    Lehzen entrusted me with things which I knew she would not like me to
    tell again, and that when I was ever so naughty, I never threatened
    to tell, or ever did tell them. Lord Melbourne observed: “That is a
    fine trait.” I felt quite ashamed, on hearing this praise, that I had
    said so much about myself. I asked him if his sister’s children had
    not been passionate when little. “Minny and Fanny were dreadfully
    passionate,” he said, “and now they have both very sweet tempers and
    are very calm.” I observed to him that I was sure <em>he</em> had never
    been so; he answered, “dreadfully passionate, and so I am now,” which
    I <em>would not</em> and <em>cannot</em> believe....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 13th February.</i>—Lord M. spoke of the apparent cruelty, when a person is
    dying and is suffering dreadfully, and anything to hasten the end would
    be mercy and relief, that <em>that</em> is not allowed, and is considered
    unjustifiable by law. I mentioned to Lord Melbourne a case in which
    it had been done; he told me an anecdote of Napoleon respecting this;
    when his great favourite and friend Duroc was so frightfully wounded,
    the lower part of his body being carried away—Napoleon came to him, and
    Duroc implored him to give him laudanum to alleviate his sufferings
    and hasten his end, but Napoleon would not do it, and said he could
    not sanction such a thing. Lord Melbourne observed, “If they get the
    habit of doing such a thing” (hastening the end) “when a person is in a
    hopeless state, why, they <em>may</em> do it when a person is <em>not</em>
    in a hopeless state.” Spoke of Lord Leveson<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> who is such a very
    odd-looking young man; Lord Melbourne said that Lady Granville “was
    always very ugly,” and that “she is <em>now</em> better looking than
    she used to be.” Spoke of large dogs, which Lord Melbourne thinks
    dangerous pets, as you are always so completely at their mercy if
    they choose to do you harm. Spoke of Lady Lilford,<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> Lord and Lady
    Holland; the latter, Lord Melbourne says, always thinks <em>first</em>
    of herself and then of Lord Holland, who quite obeys her. I asked Lord
    Melbourne if Lord Glenelg was at all obstinate; he <span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>said not now, but
    that he had been, and had given great trouble in ’30 or ’31, when he
    alone opposed in the Cabinet £25,000 being proposed as an outfit for
    the Queen Dowager; and that Lord Grey had been obliged to go and tell
    the King that he could not propose it, as Lord Glenelg was so much
    against it; Lord Melbourne said that neither the King or Queen ever
    forgave this and that the King could not <em>bear</em> Lord Glenelg; he
    could neither bear Lord John Russell, who, Lord Melbourne said, he
    always called “that young man”; he also disliked Sir John Hobhouse,
    and Mr. Poulett Thomson, and latterly Lord Palmerston, though in the
    beginning he liked him very much; Mr. S. Rice he liked pretty well; the
    Lord Chancellor<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> very much, and always told Lord Melbourne that
    the Lord Chancellor was “a kind good man”; Lord Dunraven<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> thought
    the King liked him (Ld. D.), but Lord Melbourne said he thought the
    King disliked him “at bottom,” though he was confidential with him. I
    asked Lord Melbourne if he did not see the King often? Lord Melbourne
    replied not often, and never at Windsor latterly; that he was always
    very civil to him, though not very open, and always very short. He
    said (that by the paper which Taylor wrote and gave me, and which Lord
    Melbourne has read) that the King had intended, in case the Ministry
    had resigned (which Lord Melbourne said they had declared they would,
    about the Irish Corporation Bill) to send a paper round to the Duke of
    Wellington, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>Sir Robert Peel and Lord Melbourne calling upon them to
    form a Ministry. Lord Melbourne added: “He” (the late King) “was not at
    all a clever man; he was a very timid man; very easily frightened; in
    fact he was quite in Taylor’s hands; Taylor could turn him any way.”
    This I observed was a wrong thing; Lord Melbourne said certainly it
    was, “but considering the King’s character, and how difficult it was
    for him to take a resolution, one cannot say it was an unfortunate
    thing.” I observed that Taylor turned the King to the Tory side; Lord
    Melbourne said: “The Tories don’t at all consider Taylor a friend.”
    I spoke of the unfortunate day in August ’36, when the King came to
    Windsor (after having prorogued Parliament) in a great passion. Lord
    Melbourne said this was caused by the King having set his mind upon
    having a Marine executed who was recommended to mercy; Lord Minto (whom
    the King neither liked) came to Lord Melbourne in great distress and
    said: “The King will have this man hanged.” The King hated the Speaker,
    and told Lord Melbourne that all the time the Speaker was addressing
    him in the House of Lords: “Shocking voice he has.”</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 14th February.</i>—Lord M. told me that Lord John had
    written to him that he would be unable to attend the House of Commons
    next day, when this <em>anxious</em> Ballot Question comes on. Lord
    Melbourne said he did not think it quite a bad thing that Lord John
    would be away when this Ballot Question came on, as he thinks there
    will be less irritation if he is absent, and as Lord John is unwell
    and “worried about the child,” Lord Melbourne observed he “might say
    something imprudent.” I think this all very true. Lord Melbourne was
    very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>funny about caps and bonnets; he looked round the table and said,
    “There is an amazing cargo of bonnets and things come from Paris, I
    fancy,” which made us laugh; and he observed Lady Caroline’s hat and
    said he imagined that was something quite new. He spoke of Mdlle.
    Laure; we (Lady Durham and I) laughed very much and asked him how he
    knew about her; “They tell me of her,” he added, “and I fancy she has
    beautiful things.” The Duke of Wellington was in very good spirits, but
    it strikes me he is a good deal aged, particularly in appearance. Lady
    Francis Egerton<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> is a clever, agreeable little person; and, though
    much altered, is still very pretty. I sat on the sofa with Lady Francis
    and Lady Durham<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening;
    and Lord Francis not far from him; the other ladies were seated round
    the table. We (Lord Melbourne, Lord Francis and I) spoke about German
    literature—the weather—fires, the fire at Paris, &amp;c., &amp;c. Lord Francis
    is rather a silent person and it is not easy <i>de le mettre en train
    de parler</i>. I asked Lord Melbourne what the Duke of Wellington had
    told him that made him (Ld. M.) laugh so much; Lord Melbourne then told
    me the following anecdote of George IV., which caused the laughter.
    When George IV. returned from Ireland, he was very sick and suffered a
    good deal; and he stopped and rested at Badminton; upon this the Judge,
    who was sitting at the Assizes at Gloucester, imagined that he could
    not have a man executed when the King was in the County <span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>without asking
    him about it, came over to Badminton and wished the King to hear the
    case, which put the King into the greatest passion and he exclaimed,
    “What! am I to be followed all over the country with the Recorder’s
    report?...” Spoke to Lord Melbourne about Lord John’s child, and the
    anxiety of having one child only. I observed to him however that I did
    not think having more than one child lessened the anxiety about them;
    for if persons loved their children, they would be just as anxious if
    <em>one</em> of the many was ill, and would feel the loss of <em>one</em>
    as much as if he or she had but that one. Lord Melbourne said he
    thought quite so too; but that somehow or other “if there are many,
    they have seldom anything the matter with them.” He added “it is not
    the right affection for a child, if they love them only as being their
    heir, or for keeping up their name.” He said he was going home after he
    had left the Palace, as he had a great deal to do. He thinks his sister
    had better go out of town, as she is not well, and out of spirits
    since she is in London. I spoke of sons-in-law and daughters-in-law
    and observed that I thought daughters-in-law seldom got on well with
    their mothers-in-law, in which Lord Melbourne quite agreed; whereas the
    sons-in-law they generally were fond of. I asked him how his sister
    agreed with the young Lady Cowper. “Pretty well,” he replied, “but
    I don’t think she forms any exception to the rule.” Lady Ashley and
    Lady Fanny, he said, liked their sister-in-law, but had also a certain
    feeling about it; “they don’t like to see her in the same place where
    they used to see their mother.” Spoke of the very strange custom in
    Russia that on Easter Sunday <em>everybody</em> who chooses is allowed to
    <em>kiss</em> the Empress, saying at the same <span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>time “Christ is risen.”
    Lord Melbourne told me an anecdote of the Emperor of Russia. “He said
    to a sentinel, ‘Christ is risen,’ and the man answered, ‘No, he is
    not’; the Emperor started and repeated, ‘Christ is risen’; the man
    again said, ‘No, he is not, for I am a Jew.’ The Emperor said, ‘You are
    quite right.’” I was quite happy to see the very amicable and friendly
    terms on which the Duke and my excellent friend were; it is impossible
    for Lord Melbourne to be otherwise almost with anybody, and the Duke
    having behaved very well lately, and being likewise an open, frank man,
    it renders it easy for them to be so....</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 15th February.</i>—I sat on the sofa with the Duchess
    of Sutherland, the Duke of Sutherland and Lord Durham sitting
    near us. Lord Durham spoke of the King of Greece<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>; says he is
    <em>remarkably</em> plain and mean-looking, very shy and awkward
    in society, and <i>en fin</i> unable to do <em>anything</em>. The
    Sultan,<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> whom he also saw, he describes as a fine-looking but not
    “thorough-bred” looking man; short and dark, with an expression of
    treachery in his eyes....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 21st February.</i>—At about a ¼ p. 2 I went into the
    Throne room for the Levee with my Ladies &amp;c., and all the Household
    and the Ministers being in the room. The only person who I was very
    anxious to see and whom I was much interested to have seen, was
    <em>O’Connell</em>, who was presented, and of course, as everybody does
    when they are presented, kissed hands. He was in a full wig as one of
    the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>Queen’s Councillors in Ireland, and not in the brown Brutus wig
    he generally wears. He is very tall, rather large, has a remarkably
    good-humoured countenance, small features, small clever blue eyes, and
    very like his caricatures; there were likewise two of his sons, Morgan
    and John O’Connell; his son-in-law, Mr. Fitzsimon, and his nephew John
    Morgan O’Connell. Lord Melbourne told me that one of my pensioners, a
    Sir John Lade,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> one of George IV.’s associates, was dead; spoke of
    him, of another called George Lee; of old Mrs. Fox, who Lord Melbourne
    knew formerly; he said of Mr. Fox, “he took great notice of me.” Mr.
    Fox died on the 13th of September 1806. Spoke of Nelson, &amp;c., &amp;c. He
    spoke of the Committee on the Pensions which was going on; that it was
    a very fair Committee, and that there had only been a difficulty about
    one case, which was a curious one, and which is a pension given to two
    French ladies, Madame de Rohan and Madame de Longueville, daughters
    of the Duc de Biron. Lord Melbourne told me how they came to get it,
    which is as follows, and in telling which he became quite affected
    and his eyes filled with tears. When Lord Rodney went to Paris just
    before he obtained his great victory, he was arrested for debt, as
    (Lord Melbourne said) he was always without a shilling in the world;
    and the Duc de Biron said, “Though we are enemies, still it is too bad
    that a great English officer should be arrested for debt here,” and he
    paid his debts for him. Afterwards when the Duc de Biron’s daughters,
    Mmes. de Rohan and Longueville, who are the first nobility in France,
    got into distress, they sent a statement to George III. of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>what their
    father had done for Lord Rodney, and George III. gave them a pension.
    Spoke of O’Connell, and George IV., to whose Levee in Dublin he
    (O’Connell) went; Lord Melbourne said that O’Connell declared he heard
    George IV. distinctly say (when he passed) to some one, “God damn him.”
    Lord Melbourne said that George IV. was in a very awkward position
    when he was in Ireland, for that the whole country was in a ferment
    of enthusiasm believing the King to be for the Catholic Emancipation,
    whereas in his heart he was against it. I said to Lord Melbourne that
    there was rather a disagreeable business about Lord Durham’s wishing
    me to receive Lady —— at Court, which, if she had been refused at
    the late Court, it would, I feared, be impossible for me to do. Lord
    Melbourne said, “It will not do for you to reverse a sentence passed
    by the late Court in the beginning of your reign; I quite agree with
    you that you cannot do this.” He said that in general with respect
    to receiving people it was better to go according to what had been
    determined by a Court of Justice and if there was nothing against them
    there, to receive them and not to inquire into what their early lives
    had been<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 23rd February.</i>—I lamented my being <em>so</em> short,
    which Lord M. smiled at and thought no misfortune. Spoke to him of the
    Levée, the place where I stood which some people objected to, which led
    him to speak of the old Court in the time of George III., when a Levee
    and also a Drawing-room was like an <span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>Assembly; the King and Queen used
    to come into the room where the people were already assembled, and to
    walk round and speak to the people; they did not speak to everybody,
    and it was considered no offence, he said, if they did not. He said
    Queen Charlotte spoke English with a little accent, but that it was
    rather pretty. I asked him when he first went to Court; he said in the
    year 1803, he thought; it was at the time when everybody volunteered
    their services and when he was in a Volunteer Corps. Spoke of Lord
    Howe, his remaining about the Queen<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>; and when he was made to
    resign. Lord Melbourne said he (Ld. H.) seldom voted but that when he
    voted against the Reform Bill, Lord Grey was urged by an outcry from
    “his people” to press his (Ld. Howe’s) removal, which Lord Melbourne
    said was very unwise; Lord Grey went down to Windsor, and told the King
    of it, which alarmed the King a good deal; they (the King and Lord
    Grey) discussed with Taylor how it should be done; Lord Grey proposed
    his seeing the Queen upon it, which Taylor said never would do, and
    that the only way was to send for Lord Howe and make him resign, which
    he (Ld. H.) said he would do. Lord Melbourne said that the Queen had
    just come home from riding and was half undressed when Lord Howe sent
    to say he must see the Queen; she said she would see him when she was
    dressed; whereupon Lord Howe sent again to her saying the affair was
    so urgent that he must see her immediately; she buttoned up her habit
    again and saw him; he gave her the key and said he must resign, which
    Lord Melbourne said made the Queen very angry and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>rendered her still
    more hostile to Lord Grey’s Government than she already was....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 27th February.</i>—I said to Lord Melbourne that Uncle
    Leopold was amazingly frightened when the Prince of Orange came over
    with his sons, as he always imagined that the late King had <em>some
    intentions</em> about that; (meaning a marriage between me and one of
    the young Princes.) “And so he had,” said Lord Melbourne decidedly.
    “He sounded me about it,” and Lord Melbourne wrote to him (the late
    King) to say that in a political point of view, he did not think it
    a desirable thing; that the country would not like a connection with
    Holland; the King was much disappointed at this, Lord Melbourne said;
    he (the King) had always a fear about a marriage; he was afraid Mamma
    had intentions, which I observed she certainly had; and that the King
    therefore thought “he must <i>dévancer</i> her”; that Lord Melbourne
    told him, if he wished such a thing he had better be sure first if the
    <em>Parties</em> themselves liked it; for that he never could force such
    a thing; of which Lord Melbourne said the King never seemed sensible;
    at which I laughed. He said that the Prince of Orange also came to him
    (Ld. M.) from the King, and asked him if he or the Government had any
    objection to such a connection. “Personally,” Lord Melbourne said to
    him, “there could be no objection; no more than to any other Prince in
    Europe”; but at the same time he must tell him that his (the Prince’s)
    country was so situated that it would be constantly involved in war if
    any war was to break out; “I told him as much as that,” Lord Melbourne
    said, “and that I could not say anything until we saw it in some sort
    of shape or other.” This was all very curious and interesting for me to
    hear.</p>

  </div>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> early months of the year 1838 found Lord Melbourne’s Government
      in considerable difficulties. For legislative purposes the
      Parliamentary majority was impotent. It was just able to keep the
      Ministry afloat. “The Queen,” wrote Lord Palmerston, “is as steady
      to us as ever, and was in the depth of despair when she thought we
      were in danger of being turned out.”</p>

    <p>This was a year of grave trouble in Canada, but, as it turned out,
      a year full of promise for the subsequent welfare of that great
      Dominion, and for her connection with the Mother-country. The Queen
      was undoubtedly attracted by Lord Durham, the Governor-General,
      who, although impulsive and impatient of restraint, possessed
      charms of manner and appearance, together with intellectual gifts,
      which rendered his personality agreeable to those with whom he was
      brought in contact. The Queen showed great kindness to him and Lady
      Durham before their departure for Canada. She regretted his return,
      and was grieved by the quarrel between him and her Ministers.</p>

    <p>Although during this year the Queen was in the habit of taking long
      rides into the country, which were found to be very beneficial to
      her health, she worked hard, and she laboriously read, under Lord
      Melbourne’s guidance, masses of despatches and correspondence. At
      no time during her reign was she more persistent in following the
      course of public business.</p>

    <p>She was now brought a good deal into contact with Lord Palmerston,
      and was undoubtedly attracted by his great gifts, although at
      a later period of her reign his administrative methods and
      high-handed independence occasioned her much anxiety and led to
      strong remonstrance.</p>

    <p>In the month of April, King Leopold was engaged in suggesting to
      the Queen the possibility of a union between her and Prince Albert
      of Saxe-Coburg. He wrote constantly to her upon this topic, laying
      stress upon the young Prince’s goodness and distinction, and upon
      his great anxiety to see his intellectual and moral training
      perfected under the auspices of Baron Stockmar.</p>

    <p>In the course of the spring the preparations for the Queen’s
      Coronation were commenced, and she took keen interest in the detail
      of that ceremonial. It was a somewhat delicate matter to avoid
      having to invite her Uncle King Leopold and Queen Louise, but a
      hint having been dropped to the King of the Belgians, he speedily
      realised that the custom of not including crowned heads in the
      invitations to a Coronation was sound and worth preserving. “On
      mature reflection,” he wrote, “I think that a King and Queen at
      your dear Coronation might perhaps be a <i>hors d’œuvre</i>.” To
      this view the Queen graciously assented.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 6th March.</i>—It was Mr. Bulwer’s play of <cite>The Lady of
    Lyons</cite>; and we came in very soon after the beginning. I think the
    play acts well, and I like it. Macready acted well as Claude Melnotte,
    Bartley<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> was very good as Damas; and Meadows<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> as Glavis. Mr.
    Elton<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> acted fairly enough as the wicked Beauséant.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 7th March.</i>—Dressed for riding. At a few m. p. 12
    I <em>rode</em> out with Lord Conyngham, Lord Uxbridge, dear Lehzen,
    Miss Cavendish, Col. Cavendish, and Sir G. Quentin and Mr. Fozard.
    I mounted in the garden just under the terrace in order that nobody
    should know I was going to ride out. I rode my dear favourite Tartar
    who went perfectly and <em>most delightfully</em>, never shying,
    never starting through all the <em>very</em> noisy streets, rattling
    omnibuses—carts—carriages, &amp;c., &amp;c. I quite <em>love</em> him. We rode
    out through the garden, through the gate on Constitution Hill; round
    the park by the water, out at the new gate, by Lord Hill’s former
    villa, a good <span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>way on the Harrow Road, I should say within 4 or 5 miles
    of Harrow—then down a pretty narrow lane where one could fancy oneself
    2 or 300 miles from London, out by Willesden Field (where I had never
    been), and Kilburn, down the Edgware Road—Connaught Place, through
    omnibuses, carts, &amp;c., &amp;c., in at Cumberland Gate, galloped up to Hyde
    Park Corner—and in at the same garden gate at Constitution Hill, and
    safely to the Palace at 10 m. to 3. It was a lovely day, a beautiful
    and delicious ride, and I have come home quite charmed and delighted.
    I rode between Lord Conyngham and Col. Cavendish the whole way.
    Dearest Lehzen rode Rosa and felt all the better for the ride. Wrote
    my journal. Signed. Walked about. At ½ p. 4 came my kind and excellent
    Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 20 m. p. 5. He spoke to me about
    my ride; said he had just come from the Cabinet, which was about these
    Canadian prisoners<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>; viz. what is to be done with them; the revolt
    being put down they cannot be tried by Martial Law, and there is great
    difficulty as to what is to be done with them. I said to Lord Melbourne
    I hoped he was not tired from last night; he said not at all. He said:
    “I am not quite so sure of to-night; I think we shall carry it, but
    you must not be surprised if it should be the other way.” I coloured
    very much at this honest, frank avowal of our fears, from this best
    and kindest of friends; and tears were nearer than words to me at that
    moment....</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 13th March.</i>—I asked Lord Melbourne what was to take
    place concerning Slavery to-night.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Lord Melbourne then pulled out
    of his pocket the Bill or Act which is to be read to-night; he read to
    me the principal Heads of it explaining to me each part in the <em>most
    clear and agreeable</em> manner possible. I shall not have time or
    space to explain or name <em>each</em> head here, but before I do any, I
    must just observe that the necessity of this Act shows how shockingly
    cruel and cheating the Masters of the Slaves are, attempting to evade
    in every possible way what they are told to do, and what, as the Laws
    cannot be enforced on the spot, must be done by an Act of Parliament
    here.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 14th March.</i>— ... I asked Lord Melbourne how he liked
    my dress. He said he thought it “very pretty” and that “it did very
    well.” He is so natural and funny and nice about <em>toilette</em> and
    has a very good taste I think....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 17th March.</i>—Spoke of the Cabinet, which was just
    over; he said that they had been speaking about the Coronation in the
    Cabinet; and they all thought that it would be best to have it about
    the 25th or 26th of June, as it would end the Parliament well and make
    a good break; that it would be best to have it like William IV.’s,
    which would be less long. I of course agreed to this....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 21st March.</i>—Heard from Lord Melbourne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span> that “the
    House sat till ½ past eleven last night. Lord Stanhope made a long
    declamatory speech, very violent, but having in it nothing defined
    or specific, and was answered by Lord Brougham in a most able and
    triumphant defence and maintenance of the late Act for amending the
    laws for the relief of the Poor. Lord Melbourne was very sorry to be
    prevented from waiting upon Your Majesty. He is very grateful for
    Your Majesty’s enquiries and feels very well this morning....” Spoke
    of Portugal; Lord Melbourne was very much pleased with the good news,
    and with the Queen’s conduct.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> I then saw Lord Palmerston, who
    was in high spirits at the good news from Portugal. The Levée was
    over at 3. I then went for a moment to the dressing-room to ease my
    head, as my diadem (which Lord Melbourne thought “very handsome”)
    hurt me so dreadfully. After this I invested (in the Closet) the
    Marquis of Breadalbane<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> with the Order of the Thistle; Sir Thomas
    Bradford<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> with the Grand Cross of the Bath; and Lord Burghersh<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
    and General Donald McLeod were made Knights Commanders of the Order of
    the Bath. My Ladies, my whole Household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> and all the Ministers were
    present at this ceremony.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 22nd March.</i>—Lord Melbourne said he had been to see
    the Duke of Wellington this morning about asking him to be at the head
    of a Commission to be appointed to inquire into the promotions in the
    Army and in the Marines, which were so very slow in the time of peace
    and about which they were being attacked in the House of Commons. Lord
    Melbourne said the Duke had consented to it; and that his being at the
    head of it “will give it authority”; the Duke wished to know who was
    to be in the Commission; Lord Melbourne named them to him and he was
    very well satisfied with them. Lord Melbourne told me some of them,
    which are: Lord Hill, Sir Hussey Vivian, Sir Alexander Dickson,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a>
    Sir Thomas Hardy,<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> the First Lord of the Admiralty,<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> and the
    Secretary at War.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Lord Melbourne said, with the tears in his eyes
    (kind, excellent man), that the Duke was in very good humour, and “a
    very pleasant man to do business with, I think; he is so plain and
    speaks to the point.” The Duke had been reviewing the Battalions which
    are going to Canada, and praised them very much, and said “particularly
    my regiment.” The Duke said that Lord Brougham’s speech on the Poor
    Laws was the best he ever heard him make. I told Lord Melbourne that
    <em>Diet</em> was the best physician for him; he said <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>laughing, he drank
    too much <em>champagne</em>, and I added, mixed too many wines; at which
    he laughed a good deal. Spoke of the Queen Dowager who he is going to
    see at ½ p. 1 on Saturday; spoke of my calling her Queen Adelaide and
    not Queen Dowager, as it was painful to people to receive that name.
    Spoke of all changes of that kind; of the Queen Dowager’s having signed
    “<em>Subject</em>” to me the day after the King died.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

  <p><i>Friday, 23rd March.</i>—Lord Cowper is very shy and reserved and
    speaks but little. He really is the image of his mother,<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and has
    exactly the same voice and manner of speaking. The cut of the features
    is so exactly his mother’s—he looks delicate and is very thin; he has
    a mild and pleasing countenance. Lord Melbourne spoke to me of these
    Portuguese despatches which he had not yet seen. He said: “I am very
    glad the Queen has shown courage; it gives confidence....”</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 25th March.</i>—I said I had heard from Uncle Leopold,
    who seems a good deal vexed at this recommencement of this Belgian
    Question; we spoke of this and Lord Melbourne said: “I don’t like it
    at all; I think we shall get into a quarrel somehow or other, which
    is a bad thing.” He said Uncle Leopold had written to Lord Palmerston
    about this and about this Portuguese Affair; Lord Melbourne said that
    Uncle wrote that people complained and with truth that Ferdinand did
    not show himself; upon which Dietz<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> wrote that a King should not
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>show himself when his subjects are spilling their blood. Whereupon
    Uncle observed: that was a very fine German sentiment, but that if
    Louis Philippe had followed that principle, he would have lost his head
    like Louis xvi.... Of the late hurricane in Ireland; Lord Melbourne
    said trees never grew so well in Ireland and were all a little bent
    from the wind blowing across the Atlantic. He dislikes trees near a
    house, and he is very fond of thinning trees. Spoke of Claremont and
    the trees there. We then spoke of <em>names</em> (Xtian names) for a long
    while, about which Lord Melbourne was very amusing and very funny. He
    said Lady Ashley was always called <em>Minny</em>. He said: “I think
    Mary beautiful.” We spoke of Molly; “Molly is beautiful; it’s such
    a soft word, there are more liquids in it than in almost any word.”
    Then <em>Bess</em> he thinks “quite beautiful,” as also <em>Jane</em>, and
    <em>Kate</em>, and <em>Alice</em>; “Jane and Joan,” he said, “are John.”
    “Louisa,” he says, “is a fastidious name....”</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 27th March.</i>—At ½ p. 12 I rode out with Lord Conyngham,
    Lord Uxbridge, Lord Byron,<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Lady Mary, dearest Lehzen, Miss
    Cavendish, Miss Quentin, Sir F. Stovin and Col. Cavendish, and came
    home at ½ p. 3, having ridden 22 <span class="smcap">miles</span>!!! We rode very hard
    and Tartar went <span class="smcap">most</span> delightfully, <span class="smcap">never</span> was there
    <span class="smcap">such</span> a dear horse. We rode to Richmond, through part of the
    Richmond Park, out at Robin Hood Gate, and home over Wimbledon Common
    and Vauxhall Bridge. It was as hot as summer, and <em>going</em> I
    thought I should have melted; coming over Wimbledon Common there was
    some delicious air. It was a heavenly day. At 6 m. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>p. 4 came Lord
    Melbourne and stayed with me till 20 m. to 5. He seemed well. Spoke
    a good deal of my ride. The Debate lasted till 11 last night, and he
    dined and stayed at home. Spoke of the Archbishop’s having made a long
    speech last night about the Indian Worship; spoke of that. Spoke of
    the Duke of Sussex and what he told me about the rank a Prime Minister
    should have, viz. that of Lord High Treasurer; Lord Melbourne said: “I
    think it had better remain as it is.”<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 28th March.</i>—Spoke of my ride; of Mr. Bulwer’s novels,
    <em>none</em> of which Lord Melbourne has read. Lady Durham said it
    was very odd that so clever a man should be vain about his personal
    appearance. Lord Melbourne replied: “I think clever people generally
    have more of those weaknesses than others.” Lord Melbourne said: “I
    always predicted he would be a genius when he was a boy; and I was sure
    he would make a figure; he used to come over to Brocket when he was
    17, and show me his poetry.” I asked Lord Melbourne if he was fond of
    novels; he said “very fond,” but that he had no time to read them now.
    Spoke of Lady Wilhelmina, who Lord Melbourne says is certainly much
    grown since last year. I said “Everybody grows but me.” He laughed and
    said, “I think you are grown....”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 29th March.</i>—I showed Lord Melbourne a bracelet with my
    portrait by Ross in it, which I’m going to give Lady Durham, which he
    thought very like.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 30th March.</i>—Got up at 10 m. to 10, and breakfasted at
    a ¼ to 11. Heard from Lord John <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>before breakfast, that Sir George
    Strickland<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> brought on this Motion for emancipating the Apprentices
    this year, last night, and was seconded by Mr. Pease<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> (the Quaker).
    Sir George Grey<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> made a speech of 2 hours and fifty minutes, and
    completely exhausted the subject. The speech was a very able one and
    Lord John thinks will change many Votes.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 1st April.</i>—I told him of the Duke of Cambridge and
    what he had said about his wish of going to the Emperor of Austria’s
    Coronation; and also that he said he could not dine with me on Tuesday,
    but <em>invited himself</em> to dine with me another day <em>without</em>
    the Duchess; Lord Melbourne laughed and said, “That’s very odd; Your
    Majesty should have said ‘That’s not right.’” Spoke of Little Holland
    House, which Lord Melbourne says is quite near Holland House and a
    very nice place, with a very pretty garden; spoke of Miss Fox, Lord
    Holland’s sister, who is such an amiable person; we were not sure of
    her age; Lord Melbourne said she was grown up when he was a boy at
    school; spoke of Lady Holland, who has been very handsome though he
    always remembers her very large; and she has a vulgar mouth and used
    always to say, “A vulgar ordinary mouth I have.” Spoke of her and Lady
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>Lilford, who, Lord Melbourne said laughing, “never had the use of her
    legs.” Lady Holland is about 68, he thinks; she was married in 1786 to
    her 1st husband, Sir Godfrey Webster, when she was only 16. Spoke of
    Portugal &amp;c....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 2nd April.</i>—I said to Lord Melbourne I was so stupid
    that I must beg him to explain to me about Sir William Follett<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a>
    again; he answered very kindly, “It is not stupid, but I daresay you
    can’t understand it,” and he explained it to me like a <em>kind</em>
    father would do to his child; he has something so fatherly, and so
    affectionate and kind in him, that one must love him.... I rode Lord
    Uxbridge’s little horse, which I have Christened <em>Uxbridge</em>, and
    which is the most charming, delightful, quiet horse possible. It has a
    most beautiful little head, is of a dark chestnut colour, if possible
    quieter than Tartar, for it never takes notice of anything; full of
    spirit, and very easy and pleasant in its canter which is faster than
    Tartar’s. It is delightful to have two such horses as Tartar and
    Uxbridge. It was a very warm, bright, clear, pleasant day. We rode to
    Hanwell through Acton; home by Castle Hill, Acton again, and in at the
    Victoria Gate, and home by the garden gate; we rode about 19 or 20
    miles. When we were near Notting Hill, or rather more at Brookgreen,
    I sent on a groom to inform Lord Melbourne (who told me last night
    he would come to me at <em>four</em> today), that I should be at home
    in a few minutes; but when I came home, they said Lord Melbourne had
    been at the gate a few minutes before, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>and on hearing I was still
    out, said “Very well,” and walked his horse away. I waited in my habit
    till 5, the hour for the House of Lords, when I felt that my good Lord
    Melbourne could not come, and I wrote to him. It is my own fault....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 4th April.</i>—Spoke of the Coronation, and the fuss the
    Princesses were in about their robes; I told Lord Melbourne that the
    Duchess of Gloucester had offered to hold the tip of my train when
    I was being crowned, as the Duchess of Brunswick had done for Queen
    Charlotte, and that I thought this very kind of the Duchess; which
    quite touched my good friend. Spoke of Hanwell, and rail-roads; I said
    I feared there were so many rail-roads that they could not all answer;
    Lord Melbourne said he feared they would not, but that he was sorry for
    it, as he was engaged in one. “I was fool enough to engage in one and
    to take 50 shares; I have already paid £1,000, and have lately had a
    call for £500 more,” he added. This rail-road is in Nottingham and he
    engaged in it about 4 years ago. I asked him if he liked rail-roads in
    general; he replied, “I don’t care about them,” which made me laugh;
    and he added that they were bad for the country as they brought such a
    shocking set of people “who commit every horror.” “They are picked men,
    who mind neither Lord nor laws, and commit every species of violence;
    nothing is safe,” he added; and “it’s more like a country in time of
    war” than peace. He spoke of Dorsetshire to Lady Portman, and she said
    it was so poor; he replied, “That’s because you don’t give enough
    wages.”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 5th April.</i>—Spoke of Lady Burghersh<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a>; Lord
    Melbourne said, “She is of a great deal of use to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>us, in a quiet way”;
    for if he wished to communicate with the Duke of Wellington, he did it
    through her; he, of course, does not wish me to mention this; but I
    hope I <em>am</em> discreet and tell but little of what he tells to me.
    Lady Burghersh is a sensible, clever woman, and has great influence
    over the Duke.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 6th April.</i>—Spoke of my ride; rail-roads; that the
    Steam-Carriage could not be stopped under 150 yards’ distance of an
    object; I observed that these Steam-Carriages are very dangerous; Lord
    Melbourne said, “Oh! none of these modern inventions consider human
    life.” Spoke of Col. Cavendish and Sir George Quentin; of horses;
    Lord Melbourne said his mare would not be well enough to come down
    to Windsor, but that he could get a horse from me there, to ride. I
    observed that Mr. Cowper complained he (Ld. M.) never rode the horses
    he should ride; “I don’t know, he never got me a horse I liked; I
    don’t think he is a very good hand at horses.” Lord Melbourne said Mr.
    Fred Byng<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> got him his present black mare; he hears a horse-dealer
    has got a horse which he thinks will do for him; the price is 160
    guineas, which he says is nothing if the horse is a good one; but a
    good deal if it is a bad one.... Spoke of Byron, who Lord Melbourne
    said would not be 50 if he were alive<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>; he said he was extremely
    handsome; had dark hair, was very lame and limped very much; I asked
    if the expression of his countenance was agreeable; he said not; “he
    had a sarcastic, sardonic expression; a contemptuous expression.” I
    asked if he was not agreeable; he said “He could be excessively so”;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>“he had a pretty smile”; “treacherous beyond conception; I believe he
    was fond of treachery.” Lord Melbourne added, “he dazzled everybody,”
    and deceived them; “for he could tell his story very well....” Lord
    Melbourne said, “The old King (George III.) had that hurried manner;
    but he was a shrewd, acute man, and most scrupulously civil.” He added
    that the King was rather tall, red in the face, large though not a
    corpulent man; prejudiced and obstinate beyond conception; spoke of
    the old Duke of Gloucester who, he said, was not a clever man but a
    good-natured man, though very proud; of the Duchess of Gloucester
    his wife; Lord Melbourne said that Horace Walpole tells that one day
    <em>he</em> (I think) gave the Duke of Gloucester a fête at Strawberry
    Hill; and the Duchess came over before to see that all was right; and
    when she came there she saw that the host had put up her arms with the
    Duke’s; she said, “God bless me! this will never do; you must take this
    down directly, this will never do; the Duke would be extremely angry
    were he to see this.” The Duchess was a Walpole by birth<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a>; she was
    first married to Lord Waldegrave; her children by that marriage were
    beautiful; they were Elizabeth, Lady Waldegrave,<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> Lady Euston,<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a>
    and Lady Hugh Seymour, who was mother to Sir Horace Seymour.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a>
    “People were very fond of her,” Lord Melbourne said....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 8th April.</i>—Lord Melbourne looked over <span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>one of the
    Volumes (the sixth) of a Work called “Lodge’s Portraits”; there are
    portraits of all sorts of famous people in it, with short Memoirs
    of them annexed to them. Lord Melbourne looked carefully over each,
    reading the accounts of the people and admiring the prints. I wish
    I had time to write down all the clever observations he made about
    <em>all</em>. It is quite <em>a delight</em> for me to hear him speak
    about all these things; he has such <em>stores</em> of knowledge; such a
    wonderful memory; he knows about everybody and everything; <em>who</em>
    they were, and <em>what</em> they did; and he imparts all his knowledge
    in such a <em>kind</em> and agreeable manner; it does me a <em>world</em>
    of good; and his conversations always <em>improve</em> one greatly. I
    shall just name a few of the people he observed upon:—<em>Raleigh</em>,
    which he thought a very handsome head; <em>Hobbes</em>, who was “an
    infidel philosopher”; he had been tutor to one of the Earls of
    Devonshire,<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> he said; <em>Knox</em>—Lord Melbourne observed that
    those Scotch Reformers were very violent people; but that Knox denied
    having been so harsh to Mary of Scots as she said he had been; <em>Lord
    Mansfield</em>, who, he said, “was great-uncle” to the present Lord;
    <em>Melanchthon</em>, whose name means Black Earth in Greek, and whose
    head he admired; <em>Pitt</em>, whose print Lord Melbourne said was very
    like; “he died in 1806 when I came into Parliament.” He (Ld. M.) came
    in for Leominster. <em>Wesley</em>; Lord Melbourne said the greatest
    number of Dissenters were Wesleyans; he read from the book that there
    were (at his death) 135,000 of his followers; <em>Porson</em>,—Lord
    Melbourne said, “I knew him; he was a great Greek scholar,” and looking
    at the print, “it’s very like him.” <em>Leibnitz</em>, a great <span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>German
    philosopher, and a correspondent of Queen Caroline, wife to George II.;
    spoke of her being so learned and her whole court too; “the Tories
    laughed at it very much”; and Swift ridiculing the Maids of Honour
    wrote, “Since they talk to Dr. Clark, They now venture in the Dark.”
    <em>Addison</em>; Lord Melbourne admires his “Spectator,” his “Cato” he
    also admires, but says it’s not like a Roman tragedy; “there is so
    much love in it.” Addison died at Holland House; he disagreed very
    much with his wife, Lady Warwick. Holland House was built, he said,
    by Rich, Lord Holland, in the reign of Charles 1st.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> <em>Madame de
    Staël</em>, whose print he thought very like; “she had good eyes, she
    was very vain of her arms.” She was over here in ’15, and died in ’17,
    aged 51; she disliked dying very much; Lord Melbourne also knew her
    daughter the Duchesse de Broglie; he said, “Louis Philippe dislikes
    <em>her</em> as much as Napoleon did <em>her Mother</em>.” Lord Melbourne
    saw Madame de Broglie for a moment when he was at Paris for the last
    time in 1825. He read from the book, with great emphasis, the following
    passage, what Napoleon said of Madame de Staël: “They pretend that
    she neither talks politics nor mentions me; but I know not how it
    happens that people seem to like me less after visiting her.” <em>Queen
    Elizabeth</em>; spoke of her, and that her Mother must have been very
    handsome. Lady Holland, he told me, has the greatest fear of dying;
    spoke of pictures; Lord Melbourne does not admire Murillo much, nor
    Rubens; he so greatly prefers the Italian Masters to any others; spoke
    of subjects for painting; of the Holy Family being <span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>constantly painted;
    “After all,” he said, “a woman and child is the most beautiful subject
    one can have.” He is going down alone to Brocket; I told him his sister
    thought Brocket so cold, and that she wanted him to put up stoves,
    which he said would “burn down the house.” “I reduced the grates,” he
    continued, “because I thought they gave heat enough; and so they do, if
    they make large fires; but they don’t know how to make fires.” He can’t
    bear Brocket in winter. He was going home and did not feel tired any
    more. He spoke of my riding very kindly. Stayed up till a ¼ p. 11. It
    was a most delightful evening.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 9th April.</i>—I showed him letters of thanks from Lords
    Fitzwilliam and Dundas and Captain Sykes, relative to my having repaid
    to the two first-named the debt incurred by my poor father and owing
    to their late fathers; and to the latter the debt owing to himself,
    accompanied by gifts. Lord Melbourne observed my sleeves (which were
    very long) with astonishment, and said “Amazing sleeves!...”</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 16th April.</i>—Lord Melbourne told me that there were
    very strange accounts of Lord Brougham and all he was <em>saying</em>
    and <em>doing</em> at Paris; his having gone to see Louis Philippe at
    11 o’clock at night, when the Swiss Guard were (as they always are)
    asleep on the staircase; they stopped him (Brougham), saying the King
    was gone to bed; upon which Brougham observed that their King had
    “very rustic habits.” Spoke of him, his visiting Lady Fitzharris<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a>;
    Lord Melbourne spoke of Brougham and his oddities; of this Review
    which he (B.) has written and which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>Lord Melbourne thinks “well
    done.” He thinks Queen Charlotte and George III. very harshly handled
    in it, and Queen Caroline amazingly puffed up; the Duke of York’s
    character he thinks the best done; he says there is a great deal which
    Brougham seems not to know; spoke of George IV.’s character, not being
    understood; of Sir William Knighton’s Memoirs which are just published,
    and which Lord Melbourne thinks it very wrong in Lady Knighton<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
    to have published; of George IV. being so completely in the hands of
    Knighton, &amp;c., &amp;c. I felt very unhappy at dinner, in spite of my being
    gay when I spoke, and I could have cried almost at every moment; so
    much so, that when I got into bed, my nerves (which had been more
    shaken by the loss of <em>dearest</em> Louis,<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> than I can express,
    and by the struggle when in company to overcome <em>grief</em> which I
    felt so acutely) could resist no longer, and more than half an hour
    elapsed, in tears, before I fell asleep. And before I was asleep I saw
    her, in my imagination, before me, dressed in her neat white morning
    gown, sitting at her breakfast in her room at Claremont; again,
    standing in my room of an evening, dressed in her best, holding herself
    so erect, as she always did, and making the low dignified curtsey so
    peculiar to herself; and lastly on her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>death-bed, pale and emaciated,
    but the expression the same, and the mind vigorous and firm as ever!
    These were the images I beheld as I lay in bed! Yet, mingled with my
    grief were feelings of thankfulness that her end was so peaceful—so
    happy!...</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 21st April.</i>—I showed Lord Melbourne the plans for
    changing the Slopes and making a new walk, and we looked over them for
    some time together. We then spoke of what <em>might</em> have happened
    when the Duke of York married; for who could foretell, Lord Melbourne
    observed, that the Duchess of York would have no children?—and that
    the late King should lose the two he had? This led us to speak of the
    whole Royal Family, their characters, of the Princesses marrying so
    late; of George III.’s dislike to their marrying, which Lord Melbourne
    did not know; of their beauty; he always thought Princess Sophia (when
    young) very pretty, though very like a Gipsy; spoke of the singular
    instance of both George III.’s and Queen Charlotte’s being very plain
    and all their children very handsome; spoke of all the Princes and
    Princesses, of the two little Princes, Octavius and Alfred, who died;
    Lord Melbourne said, George III. said when he felt he was to be unwell
    (which he always forefelt) he dreamt and thought of Octavius. Lord
    Melbourne said Queen Charlotte had fine hands and feet, a good bust,
    and a pretty figure.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 22nd April.</i>—I spoke to him of what I was to write to
    Uncle relative to Soult’s nomination<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>; Soult, he told me, is a
    large, tall man; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>looks more “like the Purser of a ship” than an
    officer; a very distinguished officer risen from the ranks, and a
    man of great abilities besides. Lord Melbourne knew him when he was
    in Paris. I asked Lord Melbourne when he was first at Paris; in 1815
    he said, which was the first time he was ever on the Continent. “We
    went,” he said (which “we” implies himself and Lady Caroline, his wife)
    “to Brussels immediately after the Battle of Waterloo, to see Fred.
    Ponsonby<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> who was desperately wounded.” This was in June 1815, and
    he went to Paris in August, and stayed there September and October and
    came back in November. He saw Uncle Leopold there then, and said he was
    extremely handsome.</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 23rd April.</i>—Lord Melbourne looked into the newspapers
    and said there was nothing in them; he read (in the papers) a denial
    from Lady Charlotte Bury<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> of her having written the book called
    <cite>Diary of the Reign</cite> (I think) <em>of George IV.</em>; Lord
    Melbourne spoke of Lady Hertford, though he of course could not
    remember her in her great beauty; he said, “My nurse nursed Lord
    Hertford,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> so that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>I used to hear a great deal about her.” The
    present Lord Hertford’s wife, he said, was a natural daughter of the
    Duke of Queensberry, called Mmé. Fagniani<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>; she is still alive
    at Paris, but Lord Hertford has long been separated from her; Lord
    Yarmouth, he said, is very clever, but always lives abroad....<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 25th April.</i>—In speaking before of Mrs. Baring,<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a>
    who, I said, from having been the most affectionate of mothers,
    latterly never asked after her children,—Lord Melbourne said with the
    tears in his eyes, “That’s a sure sign that all is over; when people
    intermit what they have been in the habit of doing.” He mentioned
    that when William III. was dying they brought him some good news from
    abroad, but he took no notice of it whatever, and said, “Je tire à ma
    fin....”</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 27th April.</i>—I showed Lord Melbourne two pictures of
    Lord Durham’s children; spoke of the beautiful boy Lord Durham lost,
    who would now be 20. Lord Melbourne said, that boy’s death was the
    cause of a dreadful scene between Durham and Lord Grey in one of the
    Cabinets. Spoke of this Flahaut<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> business, and of the wish at Paris
    to throw the blame of the whole on Uncle Leopold; spoke of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>Flahaut;
    Lord Melbourne said he (Flahaut) was first noticed by Napoleon, in the
    Russian Retreat, when in all that cold and misery he heard a young
    officer singing, and appearing quite gay; that was Flahaut; Napoleon
    said, “That is a fine young fellow,” and placed him on his Staff....
    Spoke of Lady Campbell<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> (Pamela Fitzgerald) who Lord Melbourne has
    not seen again, but from whom he has had a long letter....</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 28th April.</i>—Lord Melbourne continued, that those who
    were about the Prince of Wales<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> were not liked at Court “and vice
    versa.” And he said <em>his</em> family quite belonged to Carlton House;
    still, he added, the King and Queen were very civil to him. Speaking
    of George IV. he said, “He expected those he was fond of to go quite
    with him; to dislike those he disliked, and to like those he liked, and
    to turn with him.” He then mentioned what he told me before, that his
    (Ld. M.’s) father and mother got into disgrace, for I think 3 years,
    when Mrs. Fitzherbert was banished, and they continued seeing her; and
    when George IV. came back to Mrs. Fitzherbert he came to dine with them
    (Lord Melbourne was there the first day he came) as if nothing had
    happened, and as if he had been there the day before. Lord Melbourne
    said, before all this, that “the only thing one learns at a public
    school” is <em>punctuality</em>, and the value of time; that he never had
    a clock in his room, and always called <span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>to somebody to tell him what
    o’clock it was, which he owned was bad, as it put you in the power of
    the man to make you late. He “never carried a watch about him” in his
    life, and yet he thinks he generally knows what o’clock it is....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 30th April.</i>—I then showed him a little book relating to
    the Coronations of various of my Ancestors, and amongst others Queen
    Anne; he looked over parts of it, and glanced at one part which states
    that Queen Anne said in her first speech to Parliament that “<em>her
    heart was entirely</em> English.” Upon which Lord Melbourne told me
    that when she concluded the Peace of Utrecht, which was supposed to be
    rather favourable to the French, a Sir Samuel Garth<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> wrote a poem
    in which he said of Queen Anne: “The Queen this year has lost a part,
    Of her entirely English heart,”—which is very funny; Lord Melbourne
    did not remember what followed. Speaking of Prince George of Denmark,
    who Lord Melbourne said “was a very stupid fellow,” he added that he
    (G. of Denmark) was always saying, “Est-il possible?” to everything,
    and was always saying so whenever he was told of another Lord having
    left James II. So when James heard that George of Denmark had left
    him, he said, “So <i>Est-il possible</i> is gone at last!” I spoke
    of the Duchess of Ancaster<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> having been Queen Charlotte’s first
    Mistress of the Robes; the title of Duke of Ancaster became extinct,
    Lord Melbourne told me, and the Dowager Lady Cholmondeley<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> and
    Lord <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>Willoughby’s mother<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> were her co-heiresses. I asked him
    who was now Lord Fauconberg; he said the title was extinct<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a>; he
    was a descendant of Oliver Cromwell’s by Cromwell’s daughter Lady
    Fauconberg; Lady Charlotte Bellasyse married a person called Thomas
    Wynne, a Welshman.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> Sir Ed. Desborow, Lord Melbourne told me, is
    also a descendant of Cromwell’s by one of his daughters. I told Lord
    Melbourne what the Duke of Sussex had told me, viz. that none of his
    family “could hold their tongue,” which is very true; which made Lord
    Melbourne laugh, and still more so when I told him that the Duke, in
    speaking of the King of Hanover, called him “that other man.” After
    dinner I sat on the sofa with Lady Isabella and Lady Augusta, Lord
    Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening, and some of the other
    ladies being seated round the table. Spoke of Lady Isabella; Henry
    Fox,<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> of the Apartments at Hampton Court &amp;c.; of this Review of
    Brougham’s of Lady C. Bury’s book. Lord Melbourne said again, what he
    told me the other day, that there was much which Brougham seemed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>to
    know nothing about; he (B.) states that Mrs. Fitzherbert did not know
    when she married the King that a marriage with a Catholic could not be
    valid; Lord Melbourne says she must have known that, and that, by what
    he has heard, she was against the marriage; he said Lord Holland knows
    a good deal about it, and that it is known <em>where</em> the marriage
    took place and by whom it was celebrated. Lord Melbourne thinks it
    took place in 1784 or 5<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>; the King left her in 1795, when Lady
    Jersey got into favour, whom he put about the Princess of Wales; he
    came back to Mrs. Fitzherbert in 1802, then left her for Lady Hertford,
    quarrelled with her, and then Lady Conyngham followed; the last-named,
    I observed, was very good-natured; Lord Melbourne said, “She was the
    most good-natured, but the most rapacious; she got the most money from
    him.” Spoke of Lady Augusta Fox; Lord Melbourne said her mother, Lady
    Coventry, was Lady Mary Beauclerc, daughter of a Duke of St. Albans
    (uncle to the present Duke). Her (Lady Coventry’s) mother was a Miss
    Moses, a Jewess. Lady Holland, Lord Melbourne says, does not like
    Lady Augusta Fox. Lord Melbourne told me that the Irish Poor Law Bill
    would come up to the House of Lords next day, and that there would be
    probably a good deal next week, in the Committee about it; a great deal
    of difference of opinion; but he thinks they’ll pass it....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 4th May.</i>—Lord Melbourne told me on Wednesday evening
    that Landseer said of McLise<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>“He is beating us all; his
    imagination, grouping, and drawing is wonderful; he must soften his
    colouring perhaps a little.” Two very clever ones of Grant; a portrait
    of Lord Cowper by Lucas which is excessively like; Lord Melbourne,
    by Hayter, and my dogs by Landseer looked very well. The latter is
    too beautiful. There were also two very clever pictures by Landseer’s
    brother; there was also a very good picture by Sir Martin Shee of the
    late King; it is the likest I’ve seen; it’s so like his figure.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 5th May.</i>—We then spoke of my sitting one day to Sir
    Martin Shee; of Lord Melbourne’s having seen an Academician this
    morning who said the reason why Hayter was not elected one of their
    Members was because his character was not good; Lord Melbourne asked me
    about it; I said I did not know much about it, but that I believed he
    had quarrelled with his wife and had separated from her. “And did he
    get another?” said Lord M. I laughed and said I was not sure of that....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 7th May.</i>—We (that is Lord Melbourne, Lord Holland and I)
    spoke about the Exhibition, Landseer’s picture of my dogs, the origin
    of the dog in the Arms of the Seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, which
    Lord Holland said came originally from John of Gaunt, was adopted by
    Henry VII., abolished by James I., and restored by William IV.; spoke
    of <em>Macaws</em>, and he offered me one which belongs to Lady Holland.
    Spoke of Nightingales; Lord Melbourne said he could not distinguish
    its song from that of another bird’s; that it could be mistaken for a
    wood-lark’s, which Lord Holland denied, and they went on discussing
    the different songs of birds; we then spoke of various birds; of
    nightingales <span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>migrating; of how wonderful the migration of birds was;
    Lord Melbourne did not think it so incredible; they first went to
    France, he said, and “then they slide along the country....”</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 9th May.</i>—Lord Melbourne said he was kept in the House
    of Lords till 8, the night before; that Lord Shrewsbury<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> made
    rather a good speech, but that his (Ld. M.’s) fear was that some of the
    Roman Catholic Peers might refuse to take the Oath on account of all
    this; and then “we should have all this question” (the Roman Catholic)
    “over again.”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 10th May.</i>—At ½ p. 10 the doors were opened and I went
    through the Saloon into the other Ball-room next the Dining-room in
    which was Strauss’s band. I felt a little shy in going in, but soon
    got over it and went and talked to the people. The rooms I must say
    looked beautiful, were so well lit up, and everything so well done;
    and all done in one day. There was no crowd at all; indeed, there
    might have been more people. The dining-room looked also very handsome
    as the supper-room. The Throne-room was arranged for the tea-room. I
    danced (a Quadrille of course, as I only dance quadrilles) first (in
    the large ball-room) with George<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>; and 2ndly with Prince Nicholas
    Esterhazy; there was a valse between <span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>each quadrille; I never heard
    anything so <em>beautiful</em> in my life as Strauss’s band. We then
    went into the other ball-room where I danced two other quadrilles
    with Lord Jocelyn<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> and Lord Fitzalan<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>; the first named is
    very merry and funny. When I did not dance (which was only the case
    when valzing went on) I sat with Mamma and my Aunts, on a seat
    raised one step above the floor. Lady Fanny Cowper was my vis-à-vis
    when I danced with Lord Jocelyn. At 1 (after my quadrille with Lord
    Fitzalan) we went into the Supper-room. After supper we went into
    the large Ball-room where we remained till the last quadrille which
    I danced in Weippert’s room. I danced with Lord Cowper (who was much
    less shy and very agreeable); Lord Uxbridge (who dances remarkably
    well); Lord Douro; Lord Folkestone<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> (a great ally of mine); Lord
    Suffield<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>; and lastly with Lord Morpeth. There was a great deal
    of beauty there, amongst which were Lady Ashley, Lady Fanny Cowper,
    Lady Wilhelmina Stanhope, Lady Seymour,<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> Lady Clanricarde,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a>
    Lady Mary Vyner,<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Lady Norreys,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
    Lady Emma Herbert,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Lady
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>Clanwilliam,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a>
    Lady Mary Grimston,<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Lady Powerscourt,<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Miss
    Maude,<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> Miss Elphinstone.<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> Lady Fanny was twice my vis-à-vis,
    as was also Lady Adelaide Paget.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> I did not leave the ball-room
    till 10 m. to <em>four</em>!! and was in bed by ½ p. 4,—the sun shining.
    It was a lovely ball, so gay, so nice,—and I felt so happy and so
    merry; I had not danced for <em>so</em> long and was so glad to do so
    again! One <em>only</em> regret I had,—and that was, that my excellent,
    kind, good friend, Lord Melbourne was not there. I missed him much at
    this my first ball; he would have been pleased I think!</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 11th May.</i>—Got up at 20 m. p. 10 and breakfasted at
    ½ p. 11. Heard from my good Lord Melbourne that he was “extremely
    concerned” at not having been able to come to the Ball, but that “he
    felt so unwell and so disturbed” that he was afraid to venture; which
    was right of him, though I regret it <em>so</em> much. Heard from Lord
    John that “Sir Thomas Acland<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> gave notice yesterday that he should
    move on Monday to rescind the resolution of 1835 respecting the Church
    of Ireland. The Debate on this Question must lead to one of the most
    severe struggles of the session both in discussion and in the Division.
    Both parties have nearly all their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>strength in London. But a majority
    for Ministers, though a small one, is tolerably certain.” This gave
    me a pang which somewhat damped my very light and high spirits. We
    spoke for a long time about my Ball—who I danced with, the beauties,
    and the different persons there; I said to Lord Melbourne the moment
    I saw him, how very sorry I was that he had not come last night. We
    spoke of all this for some time, and he was so kind about it all, and
    seemed to take quite an interest in it all. He then said, “They are
    going to make another attack upon us on Monday; Sir Thomas Acland has
    given notice that he means to make a motion to rescind the Resolutions
    about the Irish Church passed in 1835, upon which we came in.” I then
    added that Lord John seemed certain about a majority, though a small
    one; Lord Melbourne said Sir Thomas Acland was a conscientious and
    not very violent man, and consequently well chosen in that respect to
    make a good effect. There is to be a Cabinet upon it tomorrow at 1;
    and Lord John is going to have a Meeting of the Members at 4. All this
    distresses me much; would to God! none of these Motions, which are so
    <em>useless</em>, were brought on. I fervently trust however that all
    will do well. Spoke of my ball, and the different people, the rooms;
    he asked if I was not tired; I said not the least, for though I had
    danced a great deal I did not valze, as I did not think it would do
    for me to valze. Lord Melbourne said eagerly, “I think you are quite
    right; that’s quite right.” Lord Melbourne dines with me tonight, I’m
    happy to say. I showed him the letter I meant to write to the King of
    Hanover, which he quite approved of. Spoke of several people at the
    Ball and several other things concerning it; of Lord Duncannon who is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>rather better but still very poorly; Lord Melbourne does not like his
    being so long ill, and suffering with so many different things; there
    is a disease in the sockets of his teeth which become quite loose, the
    teeth themselves being quite sound. Lord Melbourne said the Ponsonbys
    were generally strong, and lived to a great age; that the present Lord
    Bessborough’s father lived to a very great age; Lord Melbourne said he
    was the man of whom the following anecdote is told:—he (<em>that</em>
    Lord Bessborough) was playing at cards, at Picquet, Lord Melbourne
    thinks, when his partner dropped down dead; and he said to the Waiter,
    “Remember, if the gentleman recovers, that I’ve got such and such
    a thing in my hand....” Spoke to him of the Coronation, and of the
    different people who were to bear the Swords (which he had already
    spoken to me of, in the morning; for he showed me then a letter from
    the Duke of Grafton declining to take any part in it, as he only meant
    to attend as a Peer). He (Ld. Melbourne) will carry the Sword of State;
    the Duke of Hamilton<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> he <em>thinks</em> of proposing to carry the
    Crown; the Duke of Somerset<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> the Orb; the Dukes of Devonshire and
    Sutherland the other swords; and the Duke of Roxburgh,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> something
    else. But nothing is as yet settled with respect to all this. Spoke of
    my reading the Despatches, of which there were so many.</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 12th May.</i>—At a ¼ p. 1 came Lord Melbourne and stayed
    with me till 10 m. to 2. He said he was, and seemed, much better.
    He first read me a Petition from the Society of British Artists,
    wishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span> me to go to their Exhibition, which however he said was quite
    unnecessary. He then said they were going to have a Cabinet upon this
    motion,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> which is to take place on Monday, and to see what can
    be done upon it. Lord Melbourne then explained to me in the clearest
    manner possible all about it. He told me that:—In 1835, Sir Robert
    Peel found himself several times in minorities about various things
    which I forget; but he said he would not resign until he was beat
    upon a Question relative to the Irish Church; when he brought in his
    Bill for Irish Tithes, the resolution, to appropriate the surplus for
    the benefit of Moral Education, was carried against him by 37,—and he
    resigned; well, the present Government came in, and Lord Melbourne
    said, found this resolution an awkward one, and that there was less
    surplus than they had imagined; they however brought forward several
    Acts, and also awkward ones, Lord Melbourne said, which were each year
    rejected by the House of Lords. Well, this year the following Bill was
    brought in (which Lord Melbourne thinks a very good one, as do I, but
    which he hears will meet with a great deal of opposition), which is,
    leaving out the Appropriation Clause, and doing away with the surplus,
    but proposing to pay the Irish Church out of the funds of the Empire,
    which is separating the Irish Church from the Land, and keeping it
    up, <em>not</em> for the people, as they are almost all Catholics, but
    for the Protestant feeling in the country. Now, Lord Melbourne says,
    the <em>Church</em> don’t like it, as they think it’s making the Church
    Stipendiary and is separating it too much from the Land, and the
    <em>violent democrats</em> dislike it as they think it is giving the
    Church too <span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>much support. Lord Melbourne observes that the opposition
    will be so considerable from these two Parties that he thinks it will
    hardly be possible for <em>us</em> to carry this measure. <em>Now</em>,
    it is upon this measure being proposed on Monday that this Motion or
    amendment is to be made: “to rescind the resolution of ’35”; “that is,”
    as Lord Melbourne said, “to do away with it, to scratch it out of the
    Journals.” Lord Melbourne said that if this <em>should</em> be carried
    against us, it will be almost fatal to the Government; he added that it
    is one of those awkward sort of questions in Politics, which it is very
    difficult to get over, and at the same time hardly possible to resign
    upon; “it is not good ground to resign upon,” he said, “it would not
    be understood by the people, they would not sympathise with you.” He
    continued—but that <em>Lord John</em> might consider his honour at stake,
    and might resign upon it, which Lord Melbourne said he almost thought
    he would, but that he would hear that at the Cabinet today. He added,
    “If we have a Majority, why then it’s all well.” I observed that Lord
    John seemed to think that likely. Lord Melbourne said he certainly
    thought we should; but from the nature of the House it made it
    “ticklish” and “nervous”; which, God knows! it does. He says the Irish
    Poor Law Bill will not meet with much opposition in the House of Lords,
    except from the Irish Peers; Lord Londonderry<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> means to oppose it
    very violently. Sir Robert Peel has a great dinner today, given to
    him by his followers. Lord Melbourne said he would let me know what
    took place <span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>at the Cabinet; and if there was anything very particular
    he would come himself. He dines at the Speaker’s tonight. I cannot
    say (though I feel <em>confident</em> of <span class="smcap">our</span> <em>success</em>)
    <span class="smcap">how</span> <em>low</em>, <span class="smcap">how</span> <em>sad</em> I feel, when I think
    of the <span class="smcap">possibility</span> of this excellent and truly kind man (Lord
    Melbourne) not <em>remaining</em> my Minister! Yet I trust fervently that
    <em>He</em> who has so wonderfully protected me through such manifold
    difficulties will not <em>now</em> desert me! I should have liked to have
    expressed to Lord Melbourne my anxiety, but the tears were nearer than
    words throughout the time I saw him, and I felt I should have choked,
    had I attempted to say anything.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 13th May.</i>—In speaking of the singing of birds, which
    Lord Melbourne said he never could make out one from another, he said,
    “I never can admire the singing of birds; there’s no melody in it; it’s
    so shrill; that’s all humbug; it’s mere Poetry; it is not pretty.” This
    made us laugh; he likes the Blackbird’s singing best. He said that
    people say there is no difference between the song of a ground-lark and
    the nightingale. I observed that Lord Holland said there was. “Oh!”
    he said, “I don’t think Lord Holland knows anything about it.” “It’s
    very odd,” he continued, “Mr. Fox, and Lord Holland the same, like the
    singing of birds, and can’t bear music, nor the Human Voice....”</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 15th May.</i>— ... Heard from Lord John “that he yesterday
    brought forward the question of Irish Tithes in a speech of two hours,
    in which he endeavoured to review the whole subject. Sir Thomas Acland
    then moved to rescind the resolution of 1835. He spoke temperately and
    well. Lord Stanley made a short speech professing a desire to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>settle
    the Question; Lord Morpeth finished the debate for the night with a
    very vigorous and very effective speech. The division will probably
    take place tonight, and may be rather early.” Lord Melbourne told
    me yesterday that he thought Sir Robert Peel’s speech at the dinner
    on Saturday very moderate; but that the whole thing seemed to have
    been “rather flat....” Lord Melbourne said he did not know what the
    Council (today) was to be about; I said neither did I know, but that
    it was Lord Glenelg who wished for it. “They always run everything so
    very late in that Colonial Office,” he said; that they never thought
    <em>when</em> they would want a Council, and when they did, they said
    they wanted it immediately, and always upon the most inconvenient
    days; that to-day was a most inconvenient day for the Members of the
    House of Commons.... Lord Melbourne said that Lord Munster had been
    to see him this morning, about their (the Fitzclarences’) Pensions,
    on the Civil List, which there was some fear the Committee might make
    some difficulty about, which Lord Melbourne said would be very hard;
    Lord Munster came to show Lord Melbourne the letter he meant to write
    (to Mr. Rice, I think) about it. This pension was granted them by
    George IV. Lord Munster told Lord Melbourne that the late King always
    imagined that Lord Egremont<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> would leave Lord Munster a great deal;
    and whenever he gave Lord Munster anything, he used to write to Lord
    Egremont to tell him he had done so, which Lord Egremont did not at all
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>like and said, “This is a scheme from the beginning,” meaning that
    the King promoted the match on account of the money. Lord Melbourne
    said, “Lord Egremont was a very good man but rather suspicious”; from
    always having had a very large fortune he fancied people wanted to get
    it from him. He gave Lord Munster £5,000 about a fortnight before he
    died. Spoke of this new Election Committee Bill which Sir Robert Peel
    asked for leave to bring in. He proposes that at the beginning of each
    session the Speaker should name 6 or 4 Members who should then choose
    the Committees to try the Elections. Formerly, as Lord Melbourne told
    me once before, the Elections used to be tried by the whole House, and
    it was considered such a mark of want of confidence in the Ministers if
    their Member was unseated, that Sir Robert Walpole resigned when the
    Member for Chippenham was unseated. When this became “too flagrant”
    Lord Melbourne said, George Grenville, great-grandfather to the present
    Duke of Buckingham, made what is called “the Grenville Act,” which is
    as they are tried now; viz. the Speaker draws 40 names from glasses,
    with which Lists the different parties retire and strike off names from
    each list until they get it down to 15; and that’s the Committee. Now
    this, Lord Melbourne said, is found to be partial,<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> and a new mode
    must be devised.</p>

  <p>Lord Melbourne said Lord Redesdale<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> brought <span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>him the Duke of
    Wellington’s letter yesterday. Lord Melbourne had seen Lord John this
    morning, who thinks we shall only have a majority of 11 to-night, and
    that Mr. Hobhouse said we should have more in order to delude us into
    security.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 16th May.</i>—Got up at 10 and heard from Lord John that
    on a Division <em>we</em> had a majority of 19, which he said was more
    than he expected. How thankful I am and feel! Lord Melbourne said
    he heard that Ferdinand was annoyed at our pressing the Portuguese
    Government about the Slave Trade; and that it would be well, if I were
    to state to Ferdinand that the feeling was so strong in this country
    about Slavery, and we were so pressed about it, that it was impossible
    for us to do otherwise. I spoke to Lord Melbourne of these Resolutions
    relative to the Irish Tithe Bill, which I thought excellent, but
    which he said a very great number of people were against. I observed
    that Lord John had told me at Windsor that he thought we should not
    carry it, but that it might be compromised. Lord Melbourne then again
    repeated that the Established Church was <em>generally</em> kept up for
    the Poor, as the rich could afford that themselves; whereas in Ireland,
    700,000 are Roman Catholics, and the Established Church is <em>only</em>
    kept up for the Protestant feeling in the United Kingdom, and not for
    the Poor who are almost all Roman Catholics. I then asked about who
    should stand Sponsor in my place at the Christening of Col. and Lady
    Catharine Buckley’s<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> little boy, who is to be christened down in
    the New Forest where they lived. I said the child was to be called
    <em>Victor</em>, which I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>thought an ugly name; he did not, and said
    laughing that “Sir Victor Buckley” would sound very well....</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 18th May.</i>—We spoke of various things; I asked him if he
    liked my headdress which was done in plaits round my ears,<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> for
    I know <em>in general</em> he only likes the hair in front crêpé in 2
    puffs. He said, looking at me and making one of his funny faces, “It’s
    pretty; isn’t it rather curious—something new?”</p>

  <p><i>Saturday, 19th May.</i>—At a little after 2 I rode out with Mamma,
    Lord Uxbridge, Lord Torrington, Lady Forbes, dearest Lehzen, Lord
    Alfred, Miss Dillon, Mr. Murray, Lord Headfort, Lady Flora, Miss
    Quentin, and Col. Cavendish, and came home at 6 m. to 5. I rode dear
    little Uxbridge who went <em>perfectly</em>. We met Lord Melbourne in
    going out, who was riding his pony. We rode out by the Harrow Road
    and home by the Uxbridge Road and Park. Heard from Lord John that
    “he yesterday stated to the House of Commons the course respecting
    the Irish Bills, which he had the honour to explain to Your Majesty
    yesterday. Sir Robert Peel asked for a delay till Friday, and appeared
    much agitated; but what afterwards fell from him gives every reason
    to suppose that the Municipal Corporations Bill will not be opposed.
    Nor is it probable that the Irish Tithe Bill will meet with resistance
    from the Radical party in the House of Commons. The Chancellor of the
    Exchequer made a very clear financial statement, and the deficiency
    of the Revenue being before known, no disappointment was caused by
    the announcement. Should matters proceed smoothly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>another fortnight
    will end the chief party questions in the House of Commons.” This was
    <em>delightful</em> news.... “Very nice party” (my Concert), Lord M.
    said, “and everybody very much pleased.” I smiled and said I feared I
    had done it very ill; that I was quite angry with myself and thought
    I had done it so ill; and was not civil enough. He said most kindly,
    “Oh! no, quite the contrary, for I should have told you if it had been
    otherwise.” I then said I had felt so nervous and shy. “That wasn’t at
    all observed,” he said. I said that I often stood before a person not
    knowing what to say; and Lord Melbourne said that the longer one stood
    thinking the worse it was; and he really thought the best thing to do
    was to say anything commonplace and foolish, better than to say nothing.</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 20th May.</i>—Lord Melbourne was in delightful spirits and
    <em>so</em> talkative and <em>so</em> kind and so <span class="smcap">very agreeable</span>
    throughout the evening. I almost fear therefore (in consequence of our
    having talked so much) that I may have forgotten some of the things
    we talked about. I asked him if he had dined at Lord Shrewsbury’s the
    night before; he said no, that it was all a mistake; he went there, was
    shown upstairs, where he found Lord Shrewsbury alone with his books
    and papers, who said that all his family were gone to the Opera; Lord
    Melbourne said, “I came to dine here”; upon which Lord S. told him that
    it was <em>next</em> Saturday; Lord Melbourne said it was very stupid
    of himself to forget it, as Lord Shrewsbury had put off the dinner
    on account of him. He walked home, found his people at home, got his
    dinner in ½ an hour, and went to his sister’s. Spoke of the Preachers
    being so badly appointed at the Chapel Royal, which Lord Melbourne said
    was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>a great pity, as it would have been such “an instrument of good”
    if it had been the contrary. We looked at some prints, and amongst
    others there was a very clever one of Capt. Macheath with Polly and
    Lucy in <cite>The Beggar’s Opera</cite>; Lord Melbourne said that <cite>The
    Beggar’s Opera</cite> was written by Gay, and was used by the Tory Party
    in order to show up Lord Townshend<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> and Sir Robert Walpole; was
    very clever, and had an immense run; but is coarse beyond conception;
    it was likewise performed with great success when Lord Sandwich
    brought forward an indictment against Mr. Wilkes for immorality. Of
    Lord Teynham<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> wanting to have a Private Audience of me, which Lord
    Melbourne stopped; he said Peers are only allowed to have these Private
    Audiences to speak on Public Affairs, and not on Private concerns; that
    when the Regent wanted to prevent Lady Jersey going so often to see
    Princess Charlotte, Lord Jersey asked for a Private audience; and the
    Regent said to him, “Of course you come to speak of Public matters,
    for if you come to speak about your wife, I cannot speak to you,” and
    he spoke to him upon ordinary matters and dismissed him. Talleyrand is
    dead—at last!</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 21st May.</i>—Spoke of Talleyrand’s death, which Lord
    Melbourne said he heard was quite like that of the former French
    Ministers—like Mazarin—the house full of people to see him die. He (Ld.
    Melbourne) said he had heard that Louis Philippe <span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>and Mme. Adelaide
    had been to see Talleyrand. Spoke of his fear of dying, which Lord
    Melbourne said people always said of persons whose feelings on religion
    were rather loose. Lord Melbourne said he heard that Talleyrand had
    signed a sort of recantation to the Pope, for something he had done, at
    the time of the Revolution—for having performed Mass upon some occasion
    or other....<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a></p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 24th May.</i>—I this day enter my 20th year, which I think
    <em>very</em> old! In looking back on the past year, I feel more grateful
    than I can express for <span class="smcap">all</span> the <span class="smcap">very great blessings</span>
    I have received since my last birthday. I have only <span class="smcap">one very</span>
    dear affectionate friend less—dearest Louis! Oh! if she could but
    be still with us!! Though I have <em>lost</em> a <em>dear</em> friend,
    I can never be <em>thankful</em> enough for the <em>true, faithful,
    honest, kind</em> one I’ve <span class="smcap">gained</span> since last year, which is my
    <em>excellent</em> Lord Melbourne, who is so kind and good to me!!... At
    25 m. p. 10 I went with the whole Royal Family into the other Ball-room
    through the Saloon which was full of people; after speaking to a good
    many I went to my seat (without sitting down) and then opened the Ball
    in a Quadrille with George.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> There were about the same number of
    people there as at the 1st Ball, and a great number of Foreigners
    there. My good Lord Melbourne came up to me after my 1st Quadrille,
    but only stopped one minute, and though I saw him looking on at 3 of
    the Quadrilles I danced afterwards, he never came near me again, which
    I was very sorry for; and when I sent for him after supper, he was
    gone.... After supper I danced 4 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>Quadrilles in Strauss’s room; he
    was playing most beautifully. I danced with Lord George Paget,<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
    Lord Cantelupe,<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> Lord Milton,<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> and Lord Leveson. Count Eugene
    Zichy (cousin to Countess Zichy’s husband) wore a most beautiful
    uniform all covered with splendid turquoises; he is a handsome man,
    with a very good-natured expression, as he is too, very unaffected and
    good-humoured, and a beautiful valzer. We then went into the other
    room, and danced a regular old English Country Dance of 72 couple,
    which lasted 1 hour, from 3 till 4! I danced with Lord Uxbridge, Lord
    Cantelupe and Lady Cowper being next, and the Duke of Devonshire
    and Lady Lothian<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> on the other side. It was the merriest, most
    delightful thing possible. I left the Ball room at 10 m. p. 4, and was
    in bed at 5—broad daylight. It was a <em>delightful</em> Ball, and the
    pleasantest birthday I’ve spent for <em>many</em> years!...</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 28th May.</i>—Spoke of writing to George of Hanover,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
    which he said I should do; and also to the King of Hanover for his
    birthday; spoke of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>the report of poor George’s marrying a Russian
    Princess. He then continued saying it would raise a curious question,
    “his marrying a Greek” (of the Greek religion it is); for he believed
    that <em>only</em> marrying <em>Roman Catholics</em> was forbidden by
    <em>law</em> here (George being in the succession here). I said I thought
    it was said, <em>all</em> who were not of the <em>Reformed Religion</em>,
    without naming specifically (Greek, he says, he supposes is included
    under Roman Catholics) <em>Roman Catholic</em>. Lord Melbourne said I
    might be right, for that he had not looked at the Act for some time. He
    said he believed also that George could not marry without my leave.<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 29th May.</i>—I told him that Lord Glenelg had made me a
    present of a Black Swan; Lord Melbourne said that a <em>Black Swan</em>
    was <em>not</em> a Swan; “It’s a Goose.” Lady Mulgrave said the Ancients
    had Black Swans, and to prove it began quoting the lines from the Latin
    Grammar, which Lord Melbourne then repeated, and which I used to learn:
    “Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno.” Lord Melbourne said,
    <em>that</em> meant to describe something very rare, and which <em>did
    not exist</em>. I said to Lord Melbourne I was very glad to hear that
    he would come down to Windsor for the Eton Montem. He said, “It’s
    quite right to go, but I don’t think it’s a very pleasant thing, the
    Montem; rather foolish”; and we spoke of the Regatta on the 4th of
    June, to which I’m not going. “The Regatta as you call it,” he said to
    Lady Mulgrave; “The Boats” it used always to be called. <em>That</em> is
    in fact done <em>without</em> the consent of the Masters, and all the
    boys were generally flogged next day. Lord <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>Melbourne has not been to
    a Montem since 1809. In speaking of the head Colleger who generally
    is made the Captain, he said he was usually a big boy about 19; “More
    foolish than a boy,” Lord Melbourne said laughing; and that the
    expenses were generally so great, and the boy so extravagant for some
    time before, that he seldom <em>cleared</em> anything. I said the Montem
    generally ended in the boys’ being sick and drunk; Lord Melbourne
    said in his funny manner, he thought in these days of education, no
    boys ever got drunk or sick—which I fear is <em>not</em> the case. He
    said all this eating and drinking, “all the chocolate and tea and
    coffee” for breakfast, had got up since his time; that when he was at
    Eton, they used to cut a roll in half and put a pat of butter inside
    it and give it to you, and that you then might drink a glass of milk
    and water (for breakfast); “I never could take milk, and therefore I
    always took water,” he said, “and we did very well”; much better he
    thinks than they do now. He said that he remembered people always gave
    children what they disliked most; he used (before he went to school) to
    have <em>every</em> day boiled mutton and rice pudding, which he hated;
    “Children’s stomachs are rather squeamish,” he said; and boiled mutton
    is particularly nauseous to a child, he observed; and he hated rice
    pudding. “Somehow or other,” he said, “they found out you disliked
    it, and there it was every day”; this, he thinks (and everybody else
    almost, I think, ought to do so), a bad system. He added, “Children’s
    stomachs are rather delicate and <em>queasy</em>”; which made us all
    laugh.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 31st May.</i>—He said that Lord Mulgrave was very anxious
    about being made a Marquis at <span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>the Coronation, and that he supposed it
    must be done, but that it would offend other Earls; he added that there
    was great difficulty about making these Peers,—but that he must soon
    lay the list before me. “I shall advise Your Majesty to make as few as
    possible,” he added. It would not do, he said, to make any Members of
    the House of Commons Peers, on account of vacating their seats. Lord
    Dundas wishes to be made an Earl, he says, which he supposes should be
    granted; and Lord Barham wishes to be made Earl of Gainsborough.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
    William IV. made 16 Peers and 24 Baronets at his Coronation; and George
    IV. 15 Peers; “he was so clogged with promises,” Lord Melbourne said,
    “he had made such heaps of promises.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> three summer months of 1838 were eventful in the life of the
      young Queen. It is not only that she attended an Eton Montem (that
      quaint ceremony so graphically described in <cite>Coningsby</cite>
      by one who was in future years to be her Prime Minister), and
      not only that she held her first Review in Hyde Park (which was
      somewhat of a disappointment to her owing to Lord Melbourne having
      dissuaded her from riding on horseback), but on the 28th June she
      was crowned in Westminster Abbey. There have been many accounts
      from eye-witnesses of the Coronation of British Sovereigns. Volumes
      have been written on the subject from the earliest times. Even the
      immortal pen of Shakespeare has touched upon this great ceremonial.
      Queen Victoria’s description, however, is unique in this, that the
      writer is the Sovereign herself, and that the Coronation is painted
      from the point of view of the central figure in the picture. Owing
      to the extreme youth of the Queen, her childlike appearance, her
      fairness and fragility, and the romance attaching to her sex, owing
      also to her dignity, simplicity, and composure amid that vast
      concourse in the setting of the great Abbey, surrounded as she was
      by every circumstance of pomp and splendour, and overweighted, as
      it seemed, by the tremendous and glittering responsibility of St.
      Edward’s Crown, the ceremony appeared to onlookers extraordinarily
      moving. The Queen noticed that Lord Melbourne was deeply stirred.
      He was one of the many who were in tears.</p>

    <p>To the thousands who saw her on this occasion for the first time
      and to the millions who read the story of the Coronation, the 28th
      June, 1838, appeared to be the opening day of Queen Victoria’s
      reign. Who, among those present in the Abbey or in the streets of
      the metropolis, could foresee what her reign was to bring forth,
      and who could measure with any degree of accuracy the progress of
      the country she was about to rule, or the growth of the Empire over
      which she was destined to preside, between the day when the Crown
      was placed upon her head, and the day when it was borne away by her
      sorrowing servants from the Mausoleum at Frogmore sixty-three years
      afterwards?</p>

    <p>“The guns are just announcing,” wrote Queen Adelaide to her niece,
      “your approach to the Abbey, and as I am not near you, and cannot
      take part in the sacred ceremony of your Coronation, I must address
      you in writing to assure you that my thoughts and my whole heart
      are with you, and my prayers are offered up to heaven for your
      happiness and the prosperity and glory of your reign.” The answer
      to this prayer for the young Queen is to be found in the story of
      her reign, and it is written large in golden letters across the
      face of her Empire.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 1st June.</i>—I also told Lord Melbourne that I quite
    approved of what he had written to me (also in the afternoon) about
    the Homage at the Coronation; namely, that the Peers should <em>kiss
    my hand</em>; Lord Melbourne smiled when I said this. Lord Melbourne
    had left Lady Holland in a great fright, fearing there would be
    a thunderstorm, of which she is dreadfully afraid. We spoke of
    thunderstorms, of people being afraid of them, of there being always
    a certain degree of danger; of the danger of standing under a tree. I
    told Lord Melbourne I never could forgive him for having stood under a
    tree in that violent thunderstorm at Windsor last year; he said, “It’s
    a hundred to one that you’re not struck,” and then added smiling: “It’s
    a sublime death.” Spoke ... of Lord Durham for some time, of whose
    arrival we think we must soon hear. Lord Melbourne said, “I’ll bet
    you he’ll go by Bermuda,” which would be a good deal out of his way;
    I asked Lord Melbourne what could make Lord Durham wish to go there.
    He replied, “I’m sure I don’t know why he’s got it into his head, but
    I’ll bet you he’ll go there.” Spoke of my fear that Lord Melbourne was
    right in what he said about Lady Mary Lambton’s<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> great regret at
    leaving England, the other day; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>namely, her being attached to John
    Ponsonby,<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> which we think seems likely, as he (J. Ponsonby) is
    the <span class="smcap">only</span> person to whom Lady Mary has written since she left
    England. Spoke of Epsom, and Lord Melbourne said there was scarcely
    ever “a Derby without somebody killing himself; generally somebody
    kills himself; it is not perfect without that,” he said laughing. Spoke
    of <cite>Don Giovanni</cite>, and the Statue having laughed so much the other
    night (about which Lablache told him he was so distressed), and Lord
    Melbourne said the <em>original</em> Piece and Music was very old; and on
    my observing that I thought <em>this</em> music by Mozart old-fashioned,
    he clasped his hands and looked up in astonishment....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 3rd June.</i>—We spoke of Music; of Lord Melbourne’s going
    to sleep when Thomas Moore was singing, which he would hardly allow.
    Lord Melbourne quoted some lines to prove that Lydian music used to
    put people to sleep; and of Phrygian music, which made people fight.
    I showed Lord Melbourne the 1st number of a work called, <cite>Portraits
    of the Female Aristocracy</cite>. Then he, and also I, looked at a new
    Work called <cite>Sketches of the People and Country of the Island
    of Zealand</cite>, which are very well done. Lord Melbourne said, in
    opening it, “These are a fine race, but they eat men, and they say
    it’s almost impossible to break them of it.” He farther added, “There
    are no <em>animals</em> whatever there, and therefore they are obliged
    to eat men.” Lady Mulgrave observed that she thought they only eat
    their enemies; Lord Melbourne said, “I fancy they eat them pretty
    promiscuously.” Lord Melbourne was in excellent spirits, and very funny
    in his remarks about the different drawings; it’s always <span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>my delight to
    make him look at these sorts of things, as his remarks are always so
    clever and funny. He again said that it was so difficult to break them
    (the New Zealanders) of eating men; “for they say it’s the very best
    thing,” which made us laugh. He added, “There was an old woman who was
    sick, and they asked her what she would like to have; and she said, ‘I
    think I could eat a little piece of the small bone of a boy’s head,’”
    and he pointed laughing to his own head, explaining <em>what</em> part
    of the head that small bone was.... Lord Melbourne went on speaking of
    New Zealand, &amp;c., and said, “The English eat up everything wherever
    they go; they exterminate everything”; and Lady Mulgrave and Mr.
    Murray<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> also said that wherever the English went, they always would
    have everything their own way, and never would accommodate themselves
    to other countries. “A person in a public situation should write as few
    private letters as possible”....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 4th June.</i>—Spoke of the Eton Montem, and I told Lord
    Melbourne I was going to the Provost’s house, which he said he was
    very glad of. There were two Montems while he was at Eton; he said no
    one knows the origin of the Eton Montem. Formerly there used to be, he
    said, a Mock Sermon at Salt Hill; a boy dressed like a clergyman and
    another like a clerk delivered a sort of sermon, and in the middle of
    it the other boys kicked them down the hill; George III. put a stop
    to it, as he thought it very improper. We spoke of the Montem, and
    of giving money, and Lord Melbourne said he thought he should give
    £20. I asked Lord Melbourne what he did when Lady Holland goes down
    to Brocket. “Oh! I give up the whole house to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>her,” he replied. And
    he says she twists everything about; not only in her own room but in
    other rooms downstairs. Then she swears she has too much light, and
    puts out all the candles; then too little, and sends for more candles;
    then she shuts up first one window, then another. I showed him in the
    Genealogy of <cite>Lodge’s Peerage</cite> how Lord Barham came to his title
    and how he was related to the Earl of Gainsborough. In looking over it,
    Lord Melbourne began to speak of Sir Charles Midleton, First Lord of
    the Admiralty, made 1st Lord Barham, and maternal grandfather to Lord
    Barham. He said he was a most distinguished and clever man. He told me,
    with the tears in his eyes, an anecdote of what he (Sir C. Midleton)
    did at the time of the Mutiny.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> He was very much for those people
    and said, “I used always to think those poor fellows very hardly
    treated”; but when he heard of the Mutiny, he ordered two 74-gun ships
    to be put broadside of the ship in which the Mutineers were, and desire
    her to surrender, and if she did not, to send her to the bottom. So
    they said to him, “But if the men should disobey?” “Why, then we shall
    be in a scrape; but give your orders steadily and they won’t disobey.”
    “That was very fine,” said Lord Melbourne. Spoke of clothes, about
    which Lord Melbourne was very funny; said the fewer you had the better,
    and that he was certain it was very bad to keep things in <em>store</em>,
    at which we laughed much, and said it would be impossible for ladies
    to keep dresses in store, as the fashions always changed; and he was
    against keeping furs, as he said “The moth doth corrupt.” Spoke of Miss
    Chaworth, Byron’s first admiration, about whom Lord Melbourne told a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>story on Sunday, which I did not quite understand, and I begged him
    to repeat it which he did. It was as follows:—Miss Chaworth was told
    that she would like Lord Byron very much (she <em>did</em> admire him)
    and would in fact marry him. She said, No, she never would; for that
    if ever she married, it should be a man with two straight legs (Byron
    having one leg and foot quite deformed<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> from his birth, which made
    him limp very much); this was told to Byron, whom it shocked most
    exceedingly, as he was extremely unhappy and conscious of his lameness,
    and made him quite indignant. He went to her, made her copy a piece
    of music for him (they had been in the habit of singing together) in
    order to have a remembrance of her, took it, left the house, and never
    saw her again. Lord Melbourne told me there was an awkwardness between
    the two families; as in George II.’s reign Miss Chaworth’s ancestor
    was killed in a duel by a Lord Byron; they quarrelled at a Club, went
    upstairs, fought and Chaworth was killed<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>; Lord Melbourne said it
    was always suspected that he had been killed unfairly, as Chaworth
    was known to be the best fencer there was, and it was thought that
    Byron passed his sword through him before they fought. Miss Chaworth
    married afterwards a Mr. Musters and was very unhappy; lived on bad
    terms with her husband, and at last died deranged. Lord Melbourne said
    he saw her once, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>he went over to her place, Annesley, when he was
    staying in Nottinghamshire in 1813, and stayed there two days. She was
    then living on very bad terms with her husband, and everything was in
    a very uncomfortable state; but she was very kind to Lord Melbourne.
    I asked Lord Melbourne where Lord Byron made the acquaintance of his
    cousin, Miss Milbanke, now the Dowager Lady Byron; he said at his
    house, at Whitehall, where Byron used to come. Spoke of Irish and
    Italian servants, who Lord Melbourne says are very uncertain and not to
    be trusted. I asked Lord Melbourne if he had good servants; he said,
    “Not very”; he added, “I’m told that great drunkenness prevails in my
    house,” but that <em>he</em> never saw it, and as long as that was the
    case, he could not much complain; he, <em>of course</em>, can’t look
    after them. The man he always takes about with him, when he comes here,
    he says is a very steady, exact man, and always ready; he has risen
    from being a steward’s boy in his house. He told me that he has but
    few servants; a butler, this man, an under butler, and one footman;
    that’s all. He’s likewise told that his expenses in comparison to other
    people’s are very great; that the profuseness in his country house was
    beyond everything, people told him; <em>he</em> does <em>not</em> think the
    expense very great, in fact he says it <em>cannot</em> be, as he is so
    little at home.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 5th June.</i>—At a ¼ to 11 we got into our carriages for
    Montem. Mamma and Lady Mulgrave were with me; Lord Melbourne, Miss
    Paget, Lord Albemarle and Lady Flora were in the next carriage to mine;
    then Lady Theresa, Miss Dillon, Lord Conyngham, and Miss Davys; and
    lastly Lord Lilford, Mr. Murray; Colonel Wemyss and Col. Cavendish.
    These carriages <em>preceded</em> us in going to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>Eton. We were stopped
    on the Bridge for “Salt.” When we reached Eton College we were received
    there by the Provost,<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> Dr. Hawtrey,<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> and the other Fellows;
    we went under the Cloisters and saw all the boys march by, 3 times,
    which is a pretty sight; some of the boys were beautifully dressed.
    We then all went up to one of the rooms in the Provost’s house, where
    we looked out of the window and saw the flag flourished; we then took
    some luncheon at the Provost’s, I sitting between the Provost and
    Lord Melbourne. The only people besides our own party there, were,
    Mrs. Goodall (the Provost’s wife), Lady Braybrooke,<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Edward of
    Saxe-Weimar,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Mr. Wood,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a> and two nieces of the Provost’s. The
    room in which we lunched is hung round with many portraits of the
    young men (now mostly, if indeed not all, old) who had been at Eton;
    amongst which were Lord Grey’s, Lord Holland’s, Lord Wellesley’s, Mr.
    Canning’s.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Lord Melbourne’s was not there, which it <em>ought</em>
    to have been. Lord Melbourne, said he had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>been painted by Hoppner,
    for Dr. Langford (his Master, but not the <em>Head</em> Master, who was
    then Dr. Heath), and had been sold at the sale of his things when he
    died.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Lord Melbourne said that Lord Holland had a fine countenance
    when young, but always <em>lame</em>, there being some ossification in
    one of his legs; he was “very slim” when young!! After luncheon we got
    into our carriages again (the other carriages <em>following</em> mine),
    and drove to Salt Hill, where we saw the boy again flourish the flag.
    The heat was <em>quite intense</em>, and the crowd <em>enormous</em>! We
    got back to the Castle at 20 m. to 2. I saw Lord Melbourne from 7 m. to
    2 till 7 m. p. 2, in my room on my return. He said he was not tired,
    and was very anxious I should not be so. Spoke of the Montem, the fine
    boys; he thought they looked “very sheepish” and shy as they marched
    by; and the boy (a great big boy) who held up the bag for “Salt,” very
    shy, on the bridge. Lord Melbourne gave £10; and I £100. Lord Melbourne
    thought that the Provost and Mrs. Goodall, knew nobody, for she took
    Lord Melbourne for Lord Ebrington. It is 69 years, Lord Melbourne told
    me (the Provost had said) since he (the Provost) walked in a Montem!
    Lord Melbourne was going to dine at Lord Anglesey’s. He said he was
    going away directly. He had neither slept well. At ½ p. 2 I left
    Windsor (as I came the day before), and reached Buckingham Palace at ½
    p. 4 or 20 m. to 5....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 6th June.</i>—I showed him the letter from Uncle
    Leopold which I got yesterday, and in which he touches upon these
    unhappy Affairs, wishing <em>me</em> to prevent my Government from
    taking the lead in these Affairs, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and saying his position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
    is <i>des plus embarassantes</i>. Lord Melbourne read it over with
    great attention, and then spoke of it all most <em>kindly</em> and
    sensibly; said he did not see how we could get out of this Territorial
    Arrangement; said he felt that Uncle’s position was not an agreeable
    one, for that he was made to do what his people disliked and what was
    extremely unpopular; “and people and countries never make allowances
    for the difficulties Kings are placed in; the King is made the
    Instrument of an Act which is extremely unpopular; and all the blame
    will fall upon him.” All this is most true; we spoke of this, and of
    its being rather hard of Uncle appealing to my feelings of affection
    for him. I told him what Uncle had said of Stockmar to Van de Weyer,
    and that Stockmar said he did not fear all this, and was sure that
    Uncle would give way in a little time. Lord Melbourne said, “He always
    says that the pressure of circumstances will make him give way, but I
    think he trusts everything to that power”; which Lord Melbourne does
    not think always is the case. He was going to show the letter to Lord
    Palmerston. I showed him another letter from Ferdinand in answer to
    mine to him about the Slave Trade; he seems very anxious to do what we
    wish, but stated the difficulties are so great; which Lord Melbourne
    said was true.... Before this, Lord Melbourne said, “Immense crowd at
    the Montem; my servant told me he never saw such a number of people.”
    Lord Melbourne was in sight of us, in coming to London, already before
    Datchet. His servant also told him that there were <em>72</em> pair
    of Post-horses sent down the road yesterday, and he (Ld. M.) paid 8
    guineas for going; whereas in general he only pays 4. Spoke of the
    Montem; and of the boys <span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>there; the Collegers generally stay longer
    than the others; they must stay till there is a vacancy at King’s,
    unless they are past 19; he says there are much fewer little boys than
    there used to be; the Provost told him “they had only 20 in the lower
    form.” “People don’t send their children as early as they used to do.”
    We spoke of the Montem; the deal of money said to have been collected,
    more than ever was known. Lord Melbourne spoke of the boy who held the
    bag and looked so sheepish; of the Provost, who Lord Melbourne said was
    an excellent Master; that nobody could make a lesson so pleasant to the
    boys; and that he was “a beautiful scholar” and “a good-natured man.”
    Lord Melbourne said that “A Master should have great spirits; better
    spirits than all the boys.” He went on saying, “It’s now 42 years ago
    since I left Eton, and I should like very much to be put back to that
    time.” He would not like, he said, to go through all he <em>had</em>
    gone through; but to go back to that time, with his <em>present</em>
    experience; “I should manage them all so much better,” he said
    laughing. He spoke of the extreme love of contradiction children have;
    of the great deal of disputing there used to be formerly in private
    Society. Lord Egremont used to say, that Society was not near so
    amusing as it used to be; people were all so well educated, that there
    were no more any originals to be seen. Lord Melbourne said the love
    of arguing was at an amazing height when he was born; “People used
    to argue till they got into a passion and swore at each other.” That
    people always would find the other in the wrong....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 10th June.</i>—I told Lord Melbourne that the Queen Dowager
    had come to me the day before, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>and had told me that Chambers<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> had
    told her that she must not pass another winter in England, and wished
    her to go to Madeira, which she declared was too far off; he then named
    Malta, to which she assented, and asked my leave to go, and to have
    a frigate to go in; about which Lord Melbourne said there could not
    be the slightest difficulty. I said she told me she preferred Malta,
    as being still in <em>my</em> dominions.... Lady Mulgrave began saying
    how much mischief the Eton boys committed after the Montem, hacking
    and cutting things all to pieces. Of the Montem, its origin; the wish
    of some to abolish it; the Provost’s declaring he never would. The
    Provost, he told us, is the son of the butler of Lord Lichfield’s
    grandfather. Spoke of Dr. Hawtrey’s introducing much new learning,
    which the Provost disliked. Spoke of what the boys learn, and many
    coming away amazingly ignorant. What makes the school one, Lord
    Melbourne said, is that the most gentlemanly boys are sent there. Lord
    Melbourne told us that Talleyrand said, “La <i>meilleure</i> éducation,
    c’est l’éducation Publique Anglaise; et c’est <i>détestable</i>!” There
    is one Head Master and an Under Master, and eight other Masters at
    Eton, Lord Melbourne said. The Masters, he says, who are quite young
    men, often require more keeping in order and are more irregular than
    the boys. “<em>My opinion is</em>,” said Lord Melbourne, “that it does
    not much signify <em>what</em> is taught, if what’s taught is <em>well</em>
    taught.” Then he added, “People too often confound learning and
    knowledge with talent and abilities”; for that the two former could
    not make the two latter. Lord Melbourne was sent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>to Eton at 9 years
    old, but had been with a clergyman before, who taught him on quite a
    different principle, but very well; made him work very hard, with a
    dictionary, by himself, and at Eton they construe it to you first;
    “so that when I came to Eton I was infinitely superior to most of the
    other boys, and I could do my lessons and theirs too.” That’s because
    he <em>always</em> was cleverer than most other people. He said, “I never
    was so surprised as when I came there; I did not know what to do. It
    was perhaps 12 o’clock, and they said that I might stay out till two.
    I said, ‘What can I do? Who is to stay with me now?’ I thought it then
    very odd, for I had been accustomed to have 2 or 3 nursery-maids after
    me, not allowing me to wet my heels near the water; and here you are
    let into a field alone, with a river running through it, which is 10
    feet deep at the bank; and if you make a false step you’re drowned to a
    certainty.” Then he said his father gave him a great deal of money, and
    he ate such a quantity of tarts, made himself so sick, though he was
    only there three weeks when he first went—that he was very ill when he
    went home, with eruptions and spots over his face. This made us laugh
    much. Spoke of the fighting there, and that the Masters should never
    allow it to go on long. “I always yielded directly,” he said, “if I
    found the boy too much for me; after the first round if I found I could
    not lick the fellow, I gave it up, and said, ‘Come, this won’t do, I’ll
    go away, it’s no use standing to be knocked to pieces.’” All this and a
    great deal more Lord Melbourne told us in the funniest, most delightful
    way possible; he is <em>so</em> amusing about himself, and so clever and
    sensible about education.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 11th June.</i>—At 20 m. to 2
    Lord Palmerston introduced the Prince de Ligne to me, Uncle Leopold’s
    Ambassador to me for the Coronation; I then went into the Drawing-room
    where the Prince de Ligne (who is a gentlemanlike and rather young man)
    introduced five other Belgian gentlemen, who have accompanied him. I
    hear he came in the most splendid equipage, with four grey horses. At
    7 m. to 2 came my good Lord Melbourne and stayed with me till 5 m. to
    3. He said he was well, and we spoke of the weather. He then told me
    of the difficulty of replacing the Chief Baron of Ireland (Joy, of
    whose death he had told me last Friday), and he said it was wished, and
    he thought it was best, to make O’Loghlen, now Master of the Rolls,
    Chief Baron, and to offer the Mastership of the Rolls to O’Connell; he
    said O’Connell might possibly refuse it, but that it might likewise
    satisfy him and his party; on the other hand, the difficulties are,
    that O’Connell might not give up his <em>agitation</em>, and that “we,”
    as Lord Melbourne says, may be attacked for it by the other party. He
    then asked me twice over, “Have you any particular feeling about it?” I
    said none whatever, and therefore it is left to Ministers to offer it,
    or not, as they may think fit.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 13th June.</i>—I made Lady Mary Paget<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> sing after
    dinner which she did beautifully, two songs before the gentlemen came
    in, the pretty one from <cite>The Ambassadrice</cite>, and one by Alari;
    Lady Adelaide<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> accompanying her in the last. The gentlemen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span> then
    came in; after this Lady Mary sang the other song by Alari which she
    sang at Buckingham Palace; and then “Ah! non giunge” (Lady Adelaide
    accompanying her), <em>most beautifully</em>, with all Persiani’s
    ornaments. They, particularly Lord Anglesey, then insisted on <em>my</em>
    singing; which I did, but literally shaking with fear and fright. I
    sang “Il superbo vinctor” from <cite>Il Giuramento</cite>. Lord Melbourne
    stood opposite me, <em>listening</em>, which really is marvellous,
    considering he does not care the least about music. Lady Mary sang a
    very pretty little thing from <cite>Beatrice</cite>; and I then sang “Sogno
    talor.” We then sat down (at a ¼ p. 10), I sitting on the sofa with
    Lady Surrey, Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole evening, and
    several of the other ladies sitting round the table. I observed to Lord
    Melbourne how dreadfully frightened I had been; and he smiled and said
    “I can quite understand it.” Talked of Ascot Races; Lord Melbourne said
    he had not been to Ascot Races since he left Eton, <em>42</em> years
    ago!! The Eton boys are now not allowed to go to Ascot, but in Lord
    Melbourne’s days they were much less severe than they are now. “My
    brother” (Pen Lamb) “was a great man on the Turf. I used always to go
    to him; I always got leave all the week, and used to go all the week,
    and very good fun it used to be,” Lord Melbourne said.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 14th June.</i>—Spoke of Miss Pitt, and of our fearing she
    was attached to her brother-in-law; Lord Melbourne said such a marriage
    could not take place now<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>; that the <em>Law</em> preventing it was
    only <span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>made last year. Till then such a marriage could take place; but
    was void, if any of the parties made objections to such marriage. This
    Bill made good all such marriages which had taken place (like the Duke
    of Beaufort’s<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a>) but prevented any others being made. Lord Melbourne
    said he did not know if it was right or wrong; we spoke of it for a
    little while.<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> I then asked him if he thought it would be well, if,
    on occasions like the Races, I should wear my Star and Ribbon; he said
    yes.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> I said to him also, that, if he did not dislike it, I should
    be so very happy if he would wear the Windsor Uniform when he came down
    to Windsor; he replied kindly, “I shall be very happy,” and I added I
    hoped he would often be at Windsor.<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

  <p><i>Friday, 15th June.</i>—I told him that I had been reading in
    the morning in Coxe’s <cite>Life of Walpole</cite>; which I found very
    interesting, but that I had got a good deal puzzled with the South Sea
    Company, and the <em>Redeemable</em> and <em>Irredeemable</em> debt; and
    that it was very difficult and puzzling, which he said it was, and that
    I should not trouble or puzzle myself with that part of the book, which
    is not clearly written; and he explained to me in a few words and in
    his clear delightful way, like a father to his child, this difficult
    South Sea Scheme. We spoke of that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>strange proposition, the Peerage
    Bill,<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> which is curiously told in Coxe’s <cite>Life</cite>. “That was all
    a party scheme,” said Lord Melbourne; “and done with a view to cripple
    George II.” “If that had been done,” he continued, “there would be
    hardly any peerages left now.” Lord Melbourne was speaking of how many
    peerages, <em>of that time</em>, were extinct; and that there were now
    20 peers in the House of Lords without heirs. I likewise told him that
    the Duke of Wellington had let me know that George IV. and William IV.
    always wore the <em>Order of the Bath</em> on that day—Waterloo Day—as
    also on the anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar; and I asked Lord
    Melbourne if he thought I should do so, or not. He said he thought I
    should. I observed I did not like giving up my <em>Blue Ribbon</em>,
    <em>even</em> for one night; but if he wished it I would do so. He
    said, “If you don’t dislike it, I think you should do it; it will be
    considered a compliment to the Army....”<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 18th June.</i>—Lord Melbourne then gave me a list of the
    Creations and Advancements which are to take place, which are as
    follows:</p>

  <p>Lord Melbourne said he wished to add two more,<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> with my consent,
    namely, Lord King,<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> an Earl; and to call up Lord Carmarthen<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> to
    the House of Lords. I of course consented to both. Before I say another
    word, I must not omit to mention that I wrote a letter to Stockmar
    begging him to mention to Lord Melbourne my anxious wish to give him
    the <em>Blue Ribbon</em> (which I offered to him through Stockmar already
    last year, immediately upon my accession,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span> and which he refused in the
    most noble manner), as I said I felt I owed him so much; and he had
    been and was so very kind to me that it would grieve me to be giving
    other people honours whom I cared not about, and him nothing. Stockmar
    told me this morning he had shown Lord Melbourne my letter and that
    Lord Melbourne would speak to me on the subject. Accordingly Lord
    Melbourne said to me, “The Baron showed me your letter, and I feel very
    grateful, I am very sensible of Your Majesty’s kindness”; upon which I
    assured him he was quite right (having previously heard from Stockmar
    that he would decline it); “I hope,” he continued, “you don’t think
    I’ve any contempt for these things, but it gives me such a command”;
    which is most true; “and therefore you’ll allow me to decline it.”<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
    I added I thought him quite right but that <em>I</em> could not do less.
    This is a fine noble disinterested act, and worthy of Lord Melbourne,
    and I honour, esteem and admire him the more for it; it only increases
    my fondness of him....<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> [**F1: no anchor apparent in text]</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 22nd June.</i>—At a ¼ p. 2 came Marshal Soult, Due de
    Dalmatie, who was introduced by Lord Glenelg. I was very curious to see
    him; he is not tall, but very broad, and one leg quite crooked from
    having been severely wounded; his complexion is dark, and he has the
    appearance of great age; his features are hard, and he speaks slowly
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>and indistinctly. His eyes are piercing; he seemed much embarrassed.
    I then went into the outer room, where he presented his 12 (I think)
    Attachés to me, amongst whom were the Marquis de Dalmatie (his son),
    and his son-in-law. Wrote to Aunt Louise. At 3 came Lord Melbourne,
    and stayed with me till 4. He asked how I was, and was sorry to hear I
    had so much to do. I told him I had just seen Soult, who was so much
    embarrassed; which Lord Melbourne said he was also when he came to him;
    and that he never would understand anything, and that he made Lord
    Melbourne repeat the things over 20 times. He gave me a list of the
    names to be made Baronets on the occasion of the Coronation; there are
    30; amongst whom are Mr. E. Lytton Bulwer and Mr. Micklethwait,<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a>
    which last I must say Lord Melbourne has been most exceedingly kind
    about. I then begged him to add (to write down) the two following names
    to the list of Peers which he gave me the other day, and which he did;
    Lord King to be Earl of Lovelace, and Viscount Ockham in the County of
    Surrey; and the Marquis of Carmarthen to be called up by the title of
    Baron Osborne....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 27th June.</i>—At 20 m. p. 4 I went with Lady Lansdowne
    and Lady Barham (the Duchess of Sutherland going in her own carriage,
    as she feared an open one), and Lord Conyngham and Col. Wemyss to
    Westminster Abbey to see all the Preparations for to-morrow. The
    streets were full of people, and preparations of all kinds. I was
    received at the Abbey by Lord Melbourne, the Duke of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>Norfolk, Sir
    William Woods,<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> and Sir Benjamin Stevenson. The whole thing
    is beautifully and splendidly and very conveniently done; Lord
    Melbourne made me try the various thrones (that is, two) which was
    very fortunate, as they were both too low. I came home again as I
    went (crowds in the streets and all <em>so</em> friendly) at 5. The
    preparations for Fairs, Balloons, &amp;c. in the Parks, quite changes all,
    and the encampments of the Artillery, with all their white tents, has a
    very pretty effect. I did not think Lord Melbourne looking well, though
    he said he was better. I’m very glad I went to the Abbey, as I shall
    now know exactly where I’m to go, and be. The Duchess of Sutherland
    came to ask for further Orders a few minutes after I had got home, and
    said she had taken Lord Melbourne in her carriage to Downing Street
    which is only one step from the Abbey. He walked <em>to</em> the Abbey.
    Wrote my journal. At ½ p. 7 we dined.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 28th June!</i>—I was awoke at four o’clock by the guns
    in the Park, and could not get much sleep afterwards on account of
    the noise of the people, bands, &amp;c., &amp;c. Got up at 7 feeling strong
    and well; the Park presented a curious spectacle; crowds of people up
    to Constitution Hill, soldiers, bands, &amp;c. I dressed, having taken a
    little breakfast before I dressed, and a little after. At ½ p. 9 I
    went into the next room dressed exactly in my House of Lords costume;
    and met Uncle Ernest, Charles and Feodore (who had come a few minutes
    before into my dressing-room), Lady Lansdowne, Lady Normanby, the
    Duchess of Sutherland, and Lady Barham, all in their robes. At 10 I
    got into the State Coach with the Duchess of Sutherland and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>Lord
    Albemarle, and we began our Progress. It was a fine day, and the crowds
    of people exceeded what I have ever seen; many as there were the day
    I went to the City, it was nothing—nothing to the multitudes, the
    millions of my loyal subjects who were assembled in <em>every spot</em>
    to witness the Procession. Their good-humour and excessive loyalty was
    beyond everything, and I really cannot say <em>how</em> proud I feel to
    be the Queen of <em>such</em> a <em>Nation</em>. I was alarmed at times for
    fear that the people would be crushed and squeezed on account of the
    tremendous rush and pressure. I reached the Abbey amid deafening cheers
    at a little after ½ p. 11; I first went into a robing-room quite close
    to the entrance, where I found my eight Train-bearers: Lady Caroline
    Lennox, Lady Adelaide Paget, Lady Mary Talbot, Lady Fanny Cowper, Lady
    Wilhelmina Stanhope, Lady Anne Fitzwilliam, Lady Mary Grimston, and
    Lady Louisa Jenkinson,—all dressed alike and beautifully, in white
    satin and silver tissue, with wreaths of silver corn-ears in front,
    and a small one of pink roses round the plait behind, and pink roses
    in the trimming of the dresses. After putting on my Mantle, and the
    young ladies having properly got hold of it, and Lord Conyngham holding
    the end of it, I left the robing-room and the Procession began. The
    sight was splendid; the bank of Peeresses quite beautiful, all in their
    robes, and the Peers on the other side. My young Train-bearers were
    always near me, and helped me whenever I wanted anything. The Bishop of
    Durham<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> stood on one side near me. At the beginning of the Anthem
    where I’ve made a mark, I retired to St. Edward’s Chapel, a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>small dark
    place immediately behind the Altar, with my Ladies and Train-bearers;
    took off my crimson robe and kirtle and put on the Supertunica of Cloth
    of Gold, also in the shape of a kirtle, which was put over a singular
    sort of little gown of linen trimmed with lace; I also took off my
    circlet of diamonds, and then proceeded bare-headed into the Abbey; I
    was then seated upon St. Edward’s chair where the Dalmatic robe was
    clasped round me by the Lord Great Chamberlain. Then followed all the
    various things; and last (of those things) the Crown being placed on
    my head;—which was, I must own, a most beautiful impressive moment;
    <em>all</em> the Peers and Peeresses put on their Coronets at the same
    instant. My excellent Lord Melbourne, who stood very close to me
    throughout the whole ceremony, was <em>completely</em> overcome at this
    moment, and very much affected; he gave me <em>such</em> a kind, and I
    may say <em>fatherly</em> look. The shouts, which were very great, the
    drums, the trumpets, the firing of the guns, all at the same instant,
    rendered the spectacle most imposing. The Enthronization and the Homage
    of, 1st all the Bishops, then my Uncles, and lastly of all the Peers,
    in their respective order, was very fine. The Duke of Norfolk (holding
    for me the Sceptre with a Cross) with Lord Melbourne, stood close to
    me on my right, and the Duke of Richmond with the other Sceptre on my
    left. All my Train-bearers standing behind the Throne. Poor old Lord
    Rolle, who is 82 and dreadfully infirm, in attempting to ascend the
    steps, fell and rolled quite down, but was not the least hurt; when
    he attempted to reascend them I got up and advanced to the end of the
    steps, in order to prevent another fall. When Lord Melbourne’s turn to
    do Homage came, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>there was loud cheering; they also cheered Lord Grey
    and the Duke of Wellington; it’s a pretty ceremony; they first all
    touch the Crown; and then kiss my hand. When my good Lord Melbourne
    knelt down and kissed my hand, he pressed my hand and I grasped his
    with all my heart, at which he looked up with his eyes filled with
    tears and seemed much touched, as he was, I observed, throughout the
    whole ceremony. After the Homage was concluded I left the Throne,
    took off my Crown and received the Sacrament; I then put on my Crown
    again, and re-ascended the Throne, leaning on Lord Melbourne’s arm;
    at the commencement of the Anthem I descended from the Throne, and
    went into St. Edward’s Chapel with my Ladies, Train-bearers, and Lord
    Willoughby, where I took off the Dalmatic robe, Supertunica, and put
    on the Purple Velvet Kirtle and Mantle, and proceeded again to the
    Throne, which I ascended leaning on Lord Melbourne’s hand. There was
    another present at this ceremony, in the box immediately above the
    Royal Box, and who witnessed all; it was Lehzen, whose eyes I caught
    when on the Throne, and we exchanged smiles. She and Späth, Lady John
    Russell and Mr. Murray saw me leave the Palace, arrive at the Abbey,
    leave the Abbey and again return to the Palace!! I then again descended
    from the Throne, and repaired with all the Peers bearing the Regalia,
    my Ladies and Train-bearers, to St. Edward’s Chapel, as it is called;
    but which, as Lord Melbourne said, was more <em>unlike</em> a Chapel than
    anything he had ever seen; for, what was <em>called</em> an <em>Altar</em>
    was covered with sandwiches, bottles of wine, &amp;c. The Archbishop came
    in and <em>ought</em> to have delivered the Orb to me, but I had already
    got it. There we waited for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>some minutes; Lord Melbourne took a glass
    of wine, for he seemed completely tired; the Procession being formed, I
    replaced my Crown (which I had taken off for a few minutes), took the
    Orb in my left hand and the Sceptre in my right, and thus <em>loaded</em>
    proceeded through the Abbey, which resounded with cheers, to the first
    Robing-room, where I found the Duchess of Gloucester, Mamma, and the
    Duchess of Cambridge with their ladies. And here we waited for at least
    an hour, with <em>all</em> my ladies and Train-bearers; the Princesses
    went away about half an hour before I did; the Archbishop had put
    the ring on the wrong finger, and the consequence was that I had the
    greatest difficulty to take it off again,—which I at last did with
    great pain. Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina, and Lady Mary Grimston looked
    quite beautiful. At about ½ p. 4 I re-entered my carriage, the Crown
    on my head and Sceptre and Orb in my hand, and we proceeded the same
    way as we came—the crowds if possible having increased. The enthusiasm,
    affection and loyalty was really touching, and I shall ever remember
    this day as the <em>proudest</em> of my life. I came home at a little
    after 6,—really <em>not</em> feeling tired.<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

  <p>At 8 we dined. Besides we 13, Lord Melbourne and Lord Surrey<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> dined
    here. Lord Melbourne came up to me and said, “I must congratulate you
    on this most brilliant day,” and that all had <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>gone off <em>so</em>
    well. He said he was not tired, and was in high spirits. I sat between
    Uncle Ernest and Lord Melbourne, and Lord Melbourne between me and
    Feodore, whom he had led in. My kind Lord Melbourne was much affected
    in speaking of the whole ceremony. He asked kindly if I was tired; said
    the Sword he carried (the 1st, the Sword of State) was excessively
    heavy. I said that the Crown hurt me a good deal. He was much amused at
    Uncle Ernest’s being astonished at our still having the Litany<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a>;
    we agreed that the whole thing was a very fine sight. He thought the
    robes,<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> and particularly the Dalmatic, “looked remarkably well.”
    “And you did it all so well; excellent!” said he with the tears in his
    eyes. He said he thought I looked rather pale, and “moved by all the
    people” when I arrived; “and that’s natural.” The Archbishop’s and
    Dean’s Copes (which were remarkably handsome) were from James the 1st’s
    time; the very same that were worn at his Coronation, Lord Melbourne
    told me. Spoke of the Duc de Nemours<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> being like his father in
    face; of the young ladies’ (Train-bearers’) dresses which he thought
    beautiful; and he said he thought the Duchess of Richmond (who had
    ordered the make of the dresses, and had been much condemned by some
    of the young ladies for it) quite right. She said to him, “One thing I
    was determined about; that I would have no discussion with their Mammas
    about it.” Spoke of Talleyrand and Soult having been much struck <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>by
    the ceremony of the Coronation; of the English being far too generous
    <em>not</em> to be kind to Soult. Lord Melbourne went home the night
    before, and slept very deeply till he was woke at 6 in the morning.
    I said I did not sleep well. Spoke of the Illuminations and Uncle
    Ernest’s wish to see them.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>After dinner, before we sat down, we—that is, Charles, Lord Melbourne
    and I—spoke of the numbers of Peers at the Coronation, which Lord
    Melbourne said was unprecedented. I observed that there were very few
    Viscounts; he said, “There are very few Viscounts”<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a>; that they
    were an odd sort of title, and not really English; that they came from
    Vice-Comités; that Dukes and Barons were the only <em>real</em> English
    titles; that Marquises were likewise not English; and that they made
    people Marquises when they did not wish to make them Dukes. Spoke of
    Lord Audley who came as the 1st Baron, and who Lord Melbourne said was
    of a very old family; his ancestor was a Sir Something Audley<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
    in the time of the Black Prince, who with Chandos gained the Battle
    of Poitiers. I then sat on the sofa for a little while with Lady
    Barham and then with Charles; Lord Melbourne sitting near me the whole
    evening. Mamma and Feodore remained to see the Illuminations, and only
    came in later, and Mamma went away before I did. Uncle Ernest drove
    out to see the Illuminations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span> I said to Lord Melbourne when I
    first sat down, I felt a little tired on my feet; “You must be very
    tired,” he said. Spoke of the weight of the robes, &amp;c.; the Coronets;
    and he turned round to me, and said <em>so</em> kindly, “And you did it
    beautifully,—every part of it, with so much taste; it’s a thing that
    you can’t give a person advice upon; it must be left to a person.” To
    hear this, from this kind impartial friend, gave me great and real
    pleasure. Mamma and Feodore came back just after he said this. Spoke
    of these Bishops’ Copes, about which he was very funny; of the Pages,
    who were such a nice set of boys and who were so handy, Lord Melbourne
    said, that they kept them near them the whole time. Little Lord
    Stafford<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> and Slane (Lord Mountcharles)<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> were Pages to their
    fathers and looked lovely; Lord Paget<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> was Lord Melbourne’s Page
    and remarkably handy, he said. Spoke again of the young ladies’ dress
    about which he was very amusing; he waited for his carriage with Lady
    Mary Talbot and Lady Wilhelmina; he thinks Lady Fanny does not make as
    much show as other girls, which I would not allow. He set off for the
    Abbey from his house at ½ p. 8, and was there long before anybody else;
    he only got home at ½ p. 6, and had to go round by Kensington. He said
    there was a large breakfast in the Jerusalem Chamber, where they met
    <em>before</em> all began; he said laughing that whenever the clergy or
    a Dean and Chapter had anything to do with anything, there’s sure to
    be plenty to eat. Spoke of my intending to go <span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>to bed; he said, “You
    may depend upon it, you are more tired than you think you are.” I said
    I had slept badly the night before; he said that was my mind, and that
    nothing kept people more awake than any consciousness of a great event
    going to take place and being agitated. He was not sure if he was not
    going to the Duke of Wellington’s.</p>

  <p>Stayed in the drawing-room till 20 m. p. 11, but remained till 12
    o’clock on Mamma’s balcony looking at the fireworks in Green Park,
    which were quite beautiful.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 29th June.</i>—I told Lord M. that I had been quarrelling
    with Feodore about Louis Philippe, whom she called a Usurper, and
    that I told her he was not, and that we disagreed amazingly about it;
    he smiled. That she called our William III. and Mary Usurpers; Lord
    Melbourne said it was that strong feeling of the divine right of Kings
    which some people have; that many people would not be convinced that
    Louis Philippe had <em>not</em> organised that Revolution; but that
    it did not do, he said, to wish well to the Family and not to Louis
    Philippe as Feodore did; for that the happiness of the <em>one</em>
    depended on the <em>other</em>....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 8th July.</i>—Got up at 20 m. to 10 and breakfasted at 11.
    Signed. Heard from Lord Melbourne that, “He finds himself much better
    this morning and will wait upon Your Majesty about three or a little
    after.” At ½ p. 3 came my excellent Lord Melbourne and stayed with me
    till a ¼ p. 4. He looks very thin and pulled as I think, but was in
    excellent spirits and as kind as ever. He said he felt much better
    today, but that his knee was still stiff and had been very painful
    yesterday. It’s the same leg (the left) which was first bad, but the
    <em>foot</em> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>was nearly well; he wore large loose shoes and no straps
    to his trousers. I showed Lord Melbourne a letter from Lord Glenelg
    I had got about Lord Durham and a letter from Lady Durham. And Lord
    Melbourne showed me one from Lord Palmerston about Van de Weyer’s being
    asked, and about the Ladies of the Ambassadors having some seat at the
    Balls....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 9th July.</i>—At a ¼ p. 11 I went with Mamma and the Duchess
    of Sutherland, Feodore, Lady Barham, Lord Conyngham, Lord Albemarle,
    Miss Pitt, Lady Flora, Späth, Lord Fingall, Miss Spring Rice, and Miss
    Davys, Lady Harriet Clive and Mr. Murray to a Review in Hyde Park,
    of which I subjoin an account. I could have cried almost not to have
    <em>ridden</em> and been in <em>my right</em> place as I ought; but Lord
    Melbourne and Lord Hill thought it more prudent on account of the great
    crowd that I should not <em>this</em> time do so,<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> which however now
    they all see I might have done, and Lord Anglesey (who had the command
    of the day, looked so handsome, and did it beautifully and gracefully)
    regretted much I did not ride. I drove down the lines. All the Foreign
    Princes and Ambassadors were there, and the various uniforms looked
    very pretty. The troops never looked handsomer or did better; and I
    heard their praises from all the Foreigners and particularly from
    Soult. There was an immense crowd and all so friendly and kind to me....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 11th July.</i>—Spoke of Soult, and that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>Uncle Ernest
    said that the Duc de Nemours told him that Soult was in excellent
    humour here, in better humour than he had ever seen him. Lord Melbourne
    seemed pleased. He said he was not at all surprised at the manner in
    which the English received Soult; as they were always curious to see
    distinguished foreigners. During the War, at the Peace of Amiens when
    Marshal Orison<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> came over, they took the horses out of his carriage
    and dragged him through the streets; “and that was in the midst of
    war,” he continued. “Many people were rather annoyed at that; but
    that was from mere curiosity.” I spoke of Feodore, and asked him if
    he saw any likeness between us; he said, “I see the likeness, though
    not perhaps very strong.” I spoke of her children and of Charles (her
    eldest) being her favourite, as he was so much the fondest of her.
    Lord Melbourne said smiling that one must not judge according to that,
    and to the <em>manner</em> in which children <em>showed</em> their love;
    “Children are great dissemblers; remember how Lear was deceived by
    that. They learn to be the greatest hypocrites,” he said.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 12th July.</i>—Lord Melbourne said that they were going to
    have a Cabinet upon what O’Connell and Sir Robert Peel declared in the
    House of Commons, the day before yesterday, upon the Irish Tithes. They
    proposed that the sum left from the sum which was voted in 1833 for the
    distressed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>Clergy, should be employed to pay the arrears of Tithes
    due. I asked Lord Melbourne if he thought this a good plan; he said it
    would have the effect of quieting the people, but that it was “rather a
    lavish way of bestowing the Public Money.” In general, Lord Melbourne
    said, when any sum of the kind is voted for a certain class of people,
    many miss it who ought to get it, and many get it who ought not to get
    anything.</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 13th July.</i>—Lord Melbourne said Ellice had told him that
    they cheered Soult amazingly when he went to Eton (that day), and
    Ellice told him he must ask for a Holiday, which he did, upon which the
    Boys cheered him much more; he shook hands with some of the Boys, and
    then they all wished to shake hands with him, so he shook hands with
    the whole school....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 17th July.</i>—He (Ld. M.) said that the Sutherlands had
    a large family; and asked if the last was a boy or girl, at which I
    laughed very much, as I said he <em>ought</em> to know; he said boys were
    much more expensive than girls; there was only the girl’s dress that
    could be expensive and perhaps Masters; but nothing to what boys’ going
    to school cost. I said that younger sons were always so poor, and that
    girls married; he said certainly that was so, and even if girls did not
    marry they wanted less money. I said Feodore at one time liked having
    boys much better than girls, but she did not now, as she thought that
    boys got into more difficulties and scrapes than girls. “Men certainly
    get into more scrapes than girls,” said Lord Melbourne; “but there is
    risk in both.” We spoke of other things; and he said Lord Ebrington
    had come to him and spoken to him about its being <span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>reported that I had
    so many French things, and that the lace of the Servants’ coats came
    from France; which I said I knew nothing about, and I assured him I had
    quantities of English things, but must sometimes have French things.
    He said he knew quite well it was so, and that it was impossible not
    to have French things, if one wished to be well dressed. That it was
    not so much the material, but the make which we English could not do;
    he said they never could make a cap or a bonnet; and that the English
    women dressed so ill....</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 24th July.</i>—We spoke of Sir Edmund Lyons,<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> who writes
    such long despatches; and who Lord Melbourne has never seen before;
    he was a Naval Officer and never employed before in the Diplomatic
    Service. He was the Captain who took out Otho. I then went over to
    the Closet, where the Prince Royal of Bavaria was introduced by Lord
    Palmerston and Baron Cetto. Having neither attendants nor uniform,
    he came in morning attire. He is not quite good-looking, but nearly
    so,—slim, not very tall, but very gentlemanlike and agreeable and
    lively. I made him sit down, and he was completely <i>à son aise</i>
    and consequently put <em>me</em> at ease. I showed Lord Melbourne
    Hayter’s sketch for his great picture of the Coronation; which Lord
    Melbourne liked very much, and which was very generally admired; Lord
    Melbourne looked at it for some time observing upon each part; he
    said that Hayter would never get it as good in the large <span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>picture as
    he had got it here. I then said to Lord Melbourne that I thought the
    Coronation made him ill, and all the worry of it; he said he thought
    he would have been ill without it; “It wasn’t the <em>Coronation</em>,”
    he said, “it was all these Peerages; but I think that’s subsiding a
    little now.” I asked if Lord Derby expected being made a Duke; Lord
    Melbourne replied, “No, I don’t think he did; I told him at once
    that could not be, and that generally satisfies people.” Lord Derby
    has a very good claim for it, Lord Melbourne said, for the following
    reasons:—George III. declared he never would make any Dukes, and wished
    to reserve that Title <em>only</em> for the Royal Family; and he only
    made 2, Lord Melbourne thinks—the Duke of Northumberland and the Duke
    of Montagu<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>; Mr. Fox told the late Lord Derby that if he could
    ever make the King waive his objections, <em>he</em> should be made a
    Duke; and <em>this</em>, Lord Melbourne said, certainly was a strong
    pledge for a Whig Government; but Lord Grey passed him over (Ld. M.
    doesn’t know why) and made the Duke of Sutherland and the Duke of
    Cleveland; and Lord Derby said in his letter to Lord Melbourne, “he
    did not see why the names of Vane (D. of Cleveland), Grenville (Duke
    of Buckingham), and Grosvenor (Ld. Westminster), should be preferred
    before him.”<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> He did not mention <em>Gower</em>, Lord Melbourne
    thinks from civility, but that he <em>feels</em> the same respecting
    him. I asked <em>what Duke</em> he wished to be; Lord Melbourne said
    he supposed <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>Duke of Derby, which was formerly a Royal title, having
    belonged to the Dukes of Lancaster; he takes his title from Derby, a
    Hundred of Lancashire—<em>not</em> from the C<sup>o</sup>. of Derby. He thinks,
    Lord Melbourne continued, that he has a right to be Duke of Hamilton,
    through his mother, Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, who was daughter to
    James, 6th Duke of Hamilton, and a very handsome person; I asked who
    she married afterwards; Lord Melbourne replied, “It was a very awkward
    business; she <em>married</em> nobody; she had a great attachment for
    the Duke of Dorset” (father to the late), “Lord Derby parted from her,
    but would not divorce her, in order that she might not marry the Duke
    of Dorset.” “The Duke of Dorset,” Lord Melbourne continued, “was a
    very handsome and agreeable man; with a great deal of gallantry....”
    I asked Lord Melbourne what sort of person Charles Sheridan was; he
    said an agreeable lively young man; but rather wild. We then spoke for
    a long time about all the Sheridans. C. Sheridan was in the Admiralty
    and rose to get £300 a year; but they fancied, he said, that he was in
    bad health, and made him give it up. There are three sons, Brinsley,
    Frank (who is with Lord Normanby), and Charles; “They are, like all the
    Sheridans, clever but careless, and have no application,” he said. They
    plagued Lord Melbourne constantly to give Charles a place; and Lord
    Melbourne offered him a Clerkship in the Audit Office; but he would
    not have that, and said it was less than he had had. George Anson<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a>
    told Lord Melbourne it would be quite nonsense to give it to him, as
    he would never come, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>and there would be a complaint of him the first
    month. Lord Melbourne said that a person who leaves the situation he
    has, must not expect to be put in again in the same place he had. This
    is a £100 a year, “which is better than nothing.” I observed that a
    person who does not wish to submit to that cannot be very anxious to
    do much, in which Lord Melbourne agreed. This Charles Sheridan lives
    a good deal with the Chesterfields, and positively has nothing.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a>
    Lord Melbourne said, “I know they’ll get ruined, and we shall have to
    provide for them.” “They all have £60 a year.” There is one Charles
    Sheridan, an excessively ugly man, who is Uncle to all these people;
    he is Brinsley Sheridan’s son by his 2nd wife; his 1st wife was a
    professional singer, a Miss Linley, whom Lord Melbourne remembers when
    he was a boy; she died in 1794; she was excessively handsome<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a>; “The
    women” (Lady Seymour) “are very like her; some of them,” he said. Spoke
    of young Brinsley Sheridan running away with his wife; of Lady Seymour,
    who, Lord Melbourne said, “is the most <i>posée</i> of them all.” “She
    says those odd things,” Lord Melbourne continued, “as if they were
    quite natural.” They (the Seymours) are always teazing Lord Melbourne
    about <em>Titles</em>, and are so vexed at their boy’s having no title;
    and they never will call him anything else but the <em>Baby</em><a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a>; I
    said that was foolish; “Very foolish; and I’ve told them so,” replied
    Lord Melbourne, “but I can’t <span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>convince them.” The Sheridan<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> who
    wrote the Dictionary was Great-Grandfather to all these; his Wife was a
    very clever woman, Lord Melbourne said, and wrote some very good books;
    “they have been a very distinguished family for a long time,” he added.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 25th July.</i>—At a ¼ to 4 I <em>rode</em> out with Lady
    Portman, Lord Uxbridge, Lord Lilford, Lord Portman, Col. Buckley,
    Col. Cavendish, and Miss Quentin, &amp;c., and came home at 6. I rode
    <em>dear Tartar</em> who went most beautifully; it was a delightful
    ride; we rode to Acton, and round by East Acton home. We never rode
    <em>harder</em>. We cantered almost the whole way going out, but coming
    home we <em>galloped</em> at least for <em>3 miles</em> without <em>once</em>
    pulling up. We came home through the Park and in at the front entrance
    of the Palace. It was a charming ride. At 7 we dined. Besides we 13
    (Lady Charlemont, Lord Headfort, Lady Caroline Barrington, and Wm.
    Cowper replacing Lord Byron, Lady Tavistock, Mrs. Campbell, and Sir H.
    Seton), Lord Conyngham dined here. I sat between Lord Conyngham and
    Lord Headfort. At a ¼ p. 8 I went to the Opera with Mamma, dear Feo,
    Lady Charlemont, Lady Caroline, Miss Cavendish, Lord Conyngham, Lord
    Headfort, Mr. Cowper, Col. Buckley, Col. Cavendish, and Lady Flora.
    It was <cite>I Puritani</cite>, and Lablache and Grisi were singing their
    Duo when we came in. Unfortunately poor Grisi was taken ill, quite at
    the end of the 1st act, and was unable consequently to sing her fine
    Scene in the 2nd act. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>Fanny Elsler danced the Chachucha (at my desire)
    between the 2nd and 3rd acts.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 26th July.</i>—Lord Melbourne said, “Lord Duncannon
    tells me he thinks that marriage of Lord Shelburne’s<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> is quite
    off.” Lord Melbourne said that somebody said to him (Ld. Shelburne)
    how handsome Miss Elphinstone was; upon which he replied, “I don’t
    think so; but beauty is not the thing to look to in a Wife.” Now this
    may have been repeated to her, Lord Melbourne says, and of course
    could not please her; and the young lady may have said, Lord Melbourne
    continued, “Why, you don’t seem to show that fondness for me you ought
    to have, and therefore I think we’d better break it off altogether.”
    Lady Kerry,<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> he said, had told Lord Duncannon that she believed it
    was all off; I observed, <em>Why</em> then had Lord Lansdowne announced
    it to me, if it was not quite settled?—Lord Melbourne said, “The same
    thing happened to Lord Duncannon that happened to you”; Lord Lansdowne
    announced it to him—said it gave him great pleasure—that it was very
    nearly settled but they did not wish to speak of it for the present;
    “and two hours afterwards he got a letter from Lansdowne, saying it
    was not at all settled,” and that he should not mention it.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> Lord
    Melbourne then asked if I had got the letter he sent me, from the
    Duchess <span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>of Sutherland to him, saying her sister Lady Burlington<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
    gladly accepted the situation of Lady of the Bedchamber; and Lord
    Melbourne said, “That may now be considered as settled”; and that Lady
    Lansdowne had best be spoken to about it all; which I begged him to
    be kind enough to do, which he said he would. I told Lord Melbourne
    that Conyngham had told me that he heard from Frederic Byng, that Lord
    Essex<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> was so <em>excessively</em> pleased at my having called up
    Lady Essex (Miss Stephens, the Singer that was, and married about 2 or
    3 months ago to Lord Essex) at the Ball, and having spoken to her; this
    touched Lord Melbourne; we both agreed she was a very nice person.<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
    Wrote my journal. At a ¼ to 8 I went into the Throne room with my
    Ladies and Gentlemen, Feo and Mamma, where I found the Duchess of
    Gloucester, the Duke of Sussex, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and
    Augusta and George. After waiting a little while we went into the green
    drawing-room, which looked very handsome lit up, and was full of people
    <em>all</em> in uniform. I subjoin an account of all the arrangements
    and all the people. After remaining for about five minutes in that
    room, talking to several people, amongst others to good Lord Melbourne,
    we went in to dinner, which was served in the Gallery, and looked, I
    must say, most brilliant and beautiful. We sat down <em>103</em>, and
    <em>might</em> have been more. The display of plate at one end of the
    room was really very handsome. I sat between Uncle Sussex and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>Prince
    Esterhazy. The music was in a small Orchestra in the Saloon, and
    sounded extremely well. Uncle Sussex seemed in very good spirits, and
    Esterhazy in high force, and full of fun, and talking so loud. I drank
    a glass of <i>stein-wein</i> with Lord Melbourne who sat a good way
    down on my left between the Duke of Devonshire and Lord Holland. After
    dinner we went into the Yellow drawing-room. Princesse Schwartzenberg
    looked very pretty but tired; and Mme. Zavadowsky beautiful, and so
    sweet and placid. About 20 m. after we ladies came in, the gentlemen
    joined us. I spoke to almost everybody; Lord Grey looked well<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a>;
    the Duke of Wellington ill but cheerful and in good spirits. I spoke
    for some time also with Lord Melbourne, who thought the Gallery looked
    very handsome, and that the whole “did very well”; “I don’t see how
    it could do better,” he said. He admired the large diadem I had on.
    At about 11 came some people who (as the Gallery was full of dinner
    &amp;c.) were obliged to come through the Closet, and of whom I annex a
    List. Lady Clanricarde I did not think looked very well; Lady Ashley,
    Lady Fanny, Lady Wilhelmina, and Lady Mary Grimston looked extremely
    pretty. Strauss played delightfully the whole evening in the Saloon.
    After staying a little while in the Saloon, we went and sat down in the
    further drawing-room, next to the dining-room. I sat on a sofa between
    Princesse Schwartzenberg and Mme. Stroganoff<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a>; Lord Melbourne
    sitting next <span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>Mme. Stroganoff, and in a little while Esterhazy near
    him, and Furstenberg (who talked amazingly to Lord Melbourne, and made
    us laugh a good deal) behind him. The Duchess of Sutherland and the
    Duchess of Northumberland sat near Princess Schwartzenberg, and a good
    many of the other Ambassadors and Ambassadresses were seated near them.
    The Duchess of Cambridge and Mamma were opposite to us; and all the
    others in different parts of the room. Several gentlemen, foreigners,
    came up behind the sofa to speak to me. We talked and laughed a
    good deal together. I stayed up till a ¼ to 1. It was a successful
    evening....</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 1st August.</i>—I asked Lord Melbourne if he saw any
    likeness in me to the Duke of Gloucester; he said none whatever; for
    that when formerly they wished to make me angry, they always said I
    was like him. I asked if Lord Melbourne remembered the Duke’s father;
    he said he did; that he was a very good man, but also very dull and
    tiresome. His two brothers were Edward, Duke of York, who died long
    before Lord Melbourne was born, and Henry, the Duke of Cumberland.
    “The Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Cumberland always remained
    Whigs,” Lord Melbourne said, “and never could understand the King’s
    (George III.) change; they said the Whigs brought their Family to
    this country; they went with the King but could not understand it.”
    Lord Melbourne said, “Whenever George IV. took offence at the church,
    he used to say, ‘By God, my Uncle the Duke of Cumberland was right
    when he told me, The people you must be apprehensive of, are those
    black-legged gentlemen.’” I said to Lord Melbourne that Princess Sophia
    Matilda told me that George III. had four illnesses. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>Lord Melbourne
    said they were not all declared illnesses. The 1st, he said, was in
    1788; the 2nd in 1800, then in 1804, which was not exactly allowed to
    be so; and the last in ’10, when he never got well again; it is said,
    Lord Melbourne told me, that he had been ill in the early part of his
    reign; as early as 63 or 4, but no one knows exactly; he had a very
    bad fever then. I observed that the Cheltenham Waters, it was said,
    brought it on the first time. Lord Melbourne said, so it was said,
    but that he did very odd things when he first went down there.... He
    used to give, Lord Melbourne said, all the orders before his being
    ill with perfect composure. Whenever he was going to be ill, the King
    heard—Lord Melbourne continued—perpetually ringing in his ears, one of
    Handel’s oratorios; and was constantly thinking of Octavius<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> who
    died, “of whom he (the King) said, ‘Heaven will be no Heaven to me if
    my Octavius isn’t there.’” But his “master delusion,” as Lord Melbourne
    expressed it, was thinking that he was married to Lady Pembroke (Lady
    Elizabeth Spencer that was, and Mother to the late Lord Pembroke, and
    who only died 7 or 8 years ago), with whom he had been very much in
    love in his young days, and very near marrying. I told Lord Melbourne
    I remembered going to see her when she was ninety, and she was very
    handsome even then. Lord Melbourne then told me how very near George
    III. was marrying Lady Sarah Lennox,<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> sister to the late Duke of
    Richmond, who was excessively handsome. Lord <span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>Melbourne said he was
    only prevented from marrying her “by her levity.” This was quite early
    in his reign. He told Lady Susan Strangways, Lord Ilchester’s Aunt,
    “Don’t you think I ought to marry a Subject? I think I ought; and that
    must be your friend” (meaning Lady Sarah Lennox); “and you may tell
    her so from me.” “Then,” Lord Melbourne continued, “she” (Lady Sarah)
    “committed every sort of folly; she entered into a flirtation with the
    Marquis of Lothian, rode out with him after a masquerade quite early in
    the morning; this was represented to the King, and <i>détournée</i>’d
    His Majesty a little,” said Lord Melbourne laughing. Nothing could
    equal the beauty of the Women at that time, said Lord Melbourne, from
    all the accounts he heard, the Duchess of Argyll and Lady Coventry,
    sisters,<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> &amp;c....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 5th August.</i>—Spoke of Lord Alfred’s<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> having gone to
    see his father’s leg, which is buried at Waterloo, and of <em>100 old
    women</em> having come to see him get into his carriage when they heard
    whose son he was. We spoke of all this; of Sir H. Vivian’s suffering
    much now, Lord Melbourne said, in consequence of a severe blow he
    got at Waterloo “by a spent grape shot.” Lord Melbourne went over to
    Brussels almost immediately <em>after</em> the battle of Waterloo, to
    see Sir Frederic Ponsonby<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> who was dreadfully wounded, stabbed
    through and through; Lord Melbourne said, though he lived for 20 years
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>afterwards, he certainly died in consequence of these wounds. I asked
    Lord Melbourne if he didn’t think Johnson’s Poetry very hard; he said
    he did, and that Garrick said, “Hang it, it’s as hard as Greek.” His
    Prose he admires, though he said pedantry was to be observed throughout
    it; and Lord Melbourne thinks what he <em>said</em> superior to what he
    <em>wrote</em>. In spite of all that pedantry, Lord Melbourne said, “a
    deep feeling and a great knowledge of human nature” pervaded all he
    said and wrote....</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 7th August.</i>—I asked him if he had seen Pozzo, which
    he told me in the evening he was going to do; he said he had, and it
    was about the Pasha of Egypt<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a>; and he said Russia would go quite
    with England in the whole affair and quite approved of England’s
    intention of sending a Fleet there; at the same time, Lord Melbourne
    said, he stated distinctly, that if we didn’t send a Fleet, they
    would be obliged to march an Army into Turkey for its protection;
    but, Lord Melbourne said he hoped, from what he saw by the last
    despatches, that the Pasha had given up the idea of declaring his
    Independence. “I think he only tried it,” Lord Melbourne said, “to
    see what effect it would make!” Lord Melbourne said he had also seen
    Lord Palmerston, and had spoken to him about these Belgian Affairs,
    which they still hope, in spite of many difficulties, to settle; and
    they have now satisfied Sebastiani,<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> who, Lord Melbourne said, was
    of a jealous disposition and thought they were going on without him
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>with Bülow<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a>; Lord Palmerston had only got from Van de Weyer a
    statement of this Debt,<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Lord Melbourne said; but that it would be
    impossible to alter; I expressed a fear of the Belgians resisting. Lord
    Melbourne said (which is quite true) that it would be very awkward if
    Uncle Leopold came over just in the midst of these Conferences, which
    would have the effect, as if he came for that purpose, and which Lord
    Melbourne said would prevent their acting as much for his interests
    as they otherwise might do. I said I quite felt it; but that Lord
    Melbourne had best send for Stockmar and get him to settle it with the
    King....</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 12th August.</i>—Saw Stockmar for a little while, and then
    took leave of this good and kind friend, which I was really sorry to
    do. He told me he had been to see Lord Melbourne, and he said I should
    have (what <em>I</em> have <em>always</em> had) the greatest confidence
    in Lord Melbourne, and ask his advice, not only in Political Matters,
    but in domestic affairs,—and ask his advice just like a <em>Father</em>,
    which are quite my feelings. Lord Melbourne was very funny about the
    Statue of the Duke of Wellington which is put up (in wood) only as a
    Trial, on the Archway on Constitution Hill,<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> and which we think
    looks dreadful and much too large; but Lord Melbourne <span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>said he thought
    a statue would look well there, and that it should be as large. We then
    observed what a pity Wyatt should do the statue, as we thought he did
    them so ill; and we mentioned George III.’s; but Lord Melbourne does
    not dislike that, and says it’s exactly like George III., and like his
    way of bowing.<a id="FNanchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> He continued, “I never will have anything to do
    with Artists; I wished to keep out of it all; for they’re a waspish set
    of people....”</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 14th August.</i>—I went and fetched the Speech, and he read
    it to me, in his beautiful, clear manner, and with that fine voice
    of his, and full of fine expression. I always feel that <em>I</em> can
    read it better when I have heard him read it. The Speech is, as Lord
    Melbourne said, “not long and safe.”</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 15th August.</i>—Lady Normanby then practised putting
    on my crown, for to-morrow. After this I read my Speech twice over,
    in my crown. Played and sang. Wrote. Wrote my journal. I forgot to
    say that I got in the morning, 2 notes from Lord Melbourne in which
    it seemed almost certain that the Prorogation could only take place
    on Friday; but at a little before 2 I got another note from him,
    in which he said that he heard from Lord John, it could take place
    next day, and therefore, that there would be a Council. I asked Lord
    Melbourne if it ever had been usual for the Sovereign to <em>read</em>
    the Speech <em>after</em> the Prime Minister had done so at the Council,
    as Lord Lansdowne had twice asked that question. Lord Melbourne said,
    never; but that the late King had done it once, when he was in a great
    state of irritation, and had said, “I will read <span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>it myself, paragraph
    by paragraph.” This was the last time the late King ever prorogued
    Parliament in person. I asked if Brougham was in the House; he said no,
    he was gone. I told him I heard Brougham had asked Lady Cowper down
    to Brougham Hall; but that she wouldn’t go; I asked if she knew him
    (Brougham) well; Lord Melbourne said very well, and “I’ve known him
    all my life; he can’t bear me now; he won’t speak to me; I’ve tried to
    speak to him on ordinary subjects in the House of Lords, but he won’t
    answer, and looks very stern”; Lord Melbourne said, laughing, “Why,
    we’ve had several severe set-to’s, and I’ve hit him very hard.” I asked
    if he (B.) didn’t still sit on the same bench with Lord Melbourne.
    “Quite on the gangway; only one between,” replied Lord Melbourne. Lord
    Melbourne and I both agreed that it was <em>since</em> the King’s death
    that Brougham was so enraged with Lord Melbourne; for, till then, he
    would have it that it was the <em>King’s</em> dislike to him (and the
    King made no objection whatever to him, Lord Melbourne told me) and
    <em>not Lord Melbourne</em>; “he wouldn’t believe me,” Lord M. said; and
    <em>now</em> he’s undeceived. Brougham always, he said, used to make a
    great many speeches. I observed that I thought if his daughter was to
    die, he would go mad; but Lord Melbourne doesn’t think so; and said, “A
    man who is always very odd never goes really mad.”</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 16th August.</i>—“You were rather nervous,”<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> said
    Lord Melbourne; to which I replied, dreadfully so; “More so than any
    time,” he continued. I asked if it was observed; he said, “I don’t
    think anyone else would have observed it, but I could see <span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>you were.”
    Spoke of my fear of reading it too low, or too loud, or too quick; “I
    thought you read it very well,” he said kindly. I spoke of my great
    nervousness, which I said I feared I never would get over. “I won’t
    flatter Your Majesty that you ever will; for I think people scarcely
    ever get over it; it belongs to a peculiar temperament, sensitive
    and susceptible; that shyness generally accompanies high and right
    feelings,” said Lord Melbourne most kindly; he was so kind and paternal
    to me. He spoke of my riding, which he thought a very good thing. “It
    gives a feeling of ease the day one has done with Parliament,” said
    Lord Melbourne. He spoke of the people in the Park when I went to the
    House; and I said how very civil the people were—<em>always</em>—to me;
    which touched him; he said it was a very good thing; it didn’t do to
    rely too much on those things, but that it was well it was there. I
    observed to Lord Melbourne how ill and out of spirits the Duke of
    Sussex was; “I have ended the Session in great charity,” said Lord
    Melbourne, “with the Duke of Wellington, but I don’t end it in charity
    with those who didn’t vote with the Duke when he voted with us”; we
    spoke of all that; “The Duke is a very great and able man,” said Lord
    Melbourne, “but he is more often wrong than right.” Lord Holland
    wouldn’t allow this; “Well, let’s throw the balance the other way,”
    continued Lord Melbourne, “but when he is wrong he is <em>very</em>
    wrong.”</p>

  <p><i>Friday, 17th August.</i>—I then told Lord Melbourne that I had so
    much to do, I didn’t think I possibly could go to Windsor on Monday;
    he said if I put off going once for that reason, I should have to
    put it off again, which I wouldn’t allow; I said there were <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>so many
    things to go, and to pack,—and so many useless things; “I wouldn’t
    take those useless things,” said Lord Melbourne laughing. I then
    added that he couldn’t have an idea of the number of things women had
    to pack and take; he said many men had quite as much,—which I said
    couldn’t be, and he continued that Lord Anglesey had <em>36</em> trunks;
    and that many men had 30 or 40 different waistcoats, and neck-cloths,
    to choose from; which made me laugh; I said a man <em>couldn’t</em>
    really want more than 3 or 4 coats for some months. He said in fact 6
    were enough for a year,—but that people had often fancies for more.
    I said our dresses required such smooth packing; “Coats ought to be
    packed smooth,” replied Lord Melbourne. I asked Lord Melbourne if
    Pozzo had spoken at all about the Belgian affairs. He said he told him
    he wouldn’t meddle with them at all. Spoke of Pozzo’s disliking Lord
    Palmerston, who didn’t, he fancied, treat him with enough <i>égard</i>;
    and Lord Melbourne said Palmerston keeps them waiting sometimes for a
    long while,—which, though they say they don’t mind it, they do mind;
    and we both agreed that he was a little apt to sneer sometimes, and to
    make it appear absurd what people said. I said, independent of Uncle’s
    coming—hurting his interests in the Conferences—his own country was in
    too disturbed a state to do so<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a>; Lord Melbourne said whatever would
    be done would be attributed to Uncle’s presence; that justice must be
    done to Belgium; but that there was such a desire in the Cabinet to
    settle the affair, that they wouldn’t be disposed to listen to any
    unreasonable demands of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>Belgium; I said one felt less anxious reading
    the Speech at the close than at the beginning of the Session. Lord
    Melbourne said he didn’t know; “The responsibility is so much greater
    during the Vacations; when Parliament is sitting one comes at once to
    Parliament; one has that to go to, and hears the worst at once....”</p>

  <p><i>Sunday, 19th August.</i>—Spoke of the Phœnix Park being
    considered unwholesome; of its being drained by what they call the
    Sub-soil-plough. He repeated the anecdote about Lord Talbot; the
    present Lord Talbot—(I believe I have already noted down the anecdote
    as he told it me twice before, but am not quite sure)—asked someone
    why they had never thought of draining the Phœnix Park, and they
    replied, “Why, your Ancestors were so much employed in draining
    the <em>Country</em>, that they had no time to think of draining the
    Park.” He said Talleyrand told an anecdote of a lady in the time of
    the Revolution who was speaking of what she would be, and she said,
    “Paysanne, oui; mais Bourgeoise, jamais.” I said to Lord Melbourne
    I was afraid he disliked the Germans, as he was always laughing at
    them, which he wouldn’t allow at all and laughed much. He said, “I’ve
    a great opinion of their talents, but not of their beauty.” He asked
    if I had seen Mr. MacNeill’s<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> despatches giving an account of his
    going into <em>Herat</em> at night; I replied, I had not; Lord Melbourne
    said it was a very curious and even fearful account, his going through
    these Barbaric Armies at night, 9 o’clock, all the Persians without,
    prepared for the Attack, and all those within, for Defence; and he gave
    an interesting account of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>one of the principal persons in Herat; Mr.
    MacNeill said he found them quite disposed to negotiate, but when he
    returned to the Shah’s camp, he found the Russian Ambassador there,
    and the Shah would listen to nothing; so Mr. MacNeill came away. Spoke
    of not liking the Cathedral Service and all that singing, and Lord
    Melbourne said, “It is inconsistent with a calm and right devotion;
    it’s papistical, and theatrical.”<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a></p>

  <p><i>Monday, 20th August.</i>—Spoke of Pozzo’s being very civil to Lord
    Melbourne; Lord Melbourne said, “He’s very fond of me,” upon which
    I said, “I don’t wonder at that,” which made Lord Melbourne smile.
    He continued, that Lord Palmerston gave Pozzo rather unnecessary
    offence by not treating him with respect and <i>égard</i>, which those
    sensitive Corsicans and Italians expect. I said to Lord Melbourne,
    I felt often ashamed at being so ignorant about many things, and at
    being obliged to ask him about so many things. He replied <span class="smcap">most
    kindly</span>, “Oh! no, you know everything very well; it’s impossible
    for anybody to know everything that it is right for them to know.”
    We spoke of the Archduke Charles, who, as Mr. Macgregor told Lord
    Melbourne, “and as we know,” he said, was a most able man, but wouldn’t
    take the slightest part in public affairs. We spoke of how many
    brothers there are still alive: Archduke Charles, Archduke Palatine,
    Archduke John, Archduke Rainer, and Archduke Louis. Spoke of Hayter’s
    Picture, and of his having made the Duchess of Sutherland so like
    already. Spoke of the Duchess of Sutherland’s features being large,
    which he agreed in; but that <span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>he liked large features, for that people
    with small features and “<em>Squeeny</em> noses” never did anything.
    Spoke of the business of the Army, which Lord Melbourne said he was
    afraid Lord Howick would bring on, and that there would be a good deal
    of difficulty about it. Lord Howick, he says, has pledged himself about
    it, and is displeased with the Horse-Guards. He (Lord Howick) is very
    indiscreet in the House of Commons, Lord Melbourne said. He has written
    Lord Melbourne a letter about this Army business, which Lord Melbourne
    told him he would answer; but he begged Lord Melbourne not to write to
    him, as long as he was at Spa,—as the letter would be read. I said I
    hoped Lord Melbourne had never found me indiscreet, or that I had ever
    repeated things which I ought not to have done. He said, “Not at all;
    no one is so discreet,” and that it was impossible sometimes to help
    letting out things. I then also begged him always to tell me, when he
    heard anything, might it be agreeable or disagreeable, and that he
    should never be afraid of telling me so; which he promised to do.<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a></p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 21st August.</i>—Lord Melbourne said he had seen Lord
    Palmerston, who told him he hoped to be able soon to bring this Belgian
    business<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>to a sort of conclusion; that he had had several
    conversations with Bülow, and Senfft,<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> “who seems a very fair
    man”; and that they think they may settle this Debt, and satisfy the
    Belgians by this slight change. “Then I talked to him,” continued Lord
    Melbourne, “about the King’s coming, and that it would be more for the
    disadvantage of his Interests.” I then spoke of my having received such
    an odd present of a Kitten in the morning, which made him laugh. (I
    got a basket, which they said came from Sir Henry Wheatley, and which
    I thought was full of flowers, and when my Maid opened it, we found a
    pretty little <em>Kitten</em> in it—which some poor people sent me as a
    present.)</p>

  <p><i>Monday, 27th August.</i>—Of Uncle Leopold; when he married Princess
    Charlotte; Lord Melbourne hadn’t the slightest acquaintance with her,
    and never had spoken to her. She never came to her father at that time.
    Lord M. said he never went near the Princess of Wales, for he said
    considering that he opposed the Regent so much in Parliament, he didn’t
    wish to oppose him in his quarrels with his Wife; for, he said, he had
    been so much with the Prince of Wales, and was so much attached to him,
    that he thought that would have been wrong.</p>

  <p><i>Tuesday, 28th August.</i>—Lord Melbourne then read me a letter
    from Lord John about all this Belgian business; he says that he
    won’t support Belgium in its new claims. Lord Melbourne said, “It’s
    very <span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>well of John saying he won’t support,” and so forth, but that
    it would be impossible for us not to take one side; our interests
    would compel us to do so; they lay so much with the Low Countries;
    England, he said, could never permit France to have possession of
    Antwerp, which was such a great Maritime place. He then read me a
    letter from Lord Minto relative to an alarm which prevails, and which
    was caused, Lord Melbourne says, by a speech the Duke of Wellington
    made in the House, about the weakness of our Naval force; which Lord
    Minto quite disclaims. Lord Melbourne sent him a paper of Sir Robert
    Inglis’s<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> about the Russian, French, and American Fleets; which
    Lord Minto says is quite erroneous; Lord Minto states that in a
    very few weeks, he could be quite ready for war; Lord M. says, what
    countries generally ruin themselves with, is, keeping up their Naval
    and Military Establishments during the time of peace; and he said,
    “Better be at War then.”<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> He owned that the Russians sending their
    fleet to the Black Sea “certainly is far from pleasant.” Then I spoke
    of Lord Ponsonby’s great alarm about Russian Influence, which Lord
    Melbourne said always was the case. Spoke of Queen Charlotte’s having
    been supposed to have had a great many presents which she was fond of,
    from Mrs. Hastings<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a>; and Lord Melbourne said the King was thought
    rather to go with Hastings, who was accused and tried for misdemeanours
    in India. There was an ivory bed-stead Queen Charlotte got, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>which
    Lord M. believed was at Frogmore now. Spoke of Queen Adelaide’s having
    got all those Shawls which the King of Oude sent. This led us to speak
    of the Crown Jewels; of there not being many, yet more than I ever
    wished to wear, of my not liking those sort of things. Lord M. said he
    didn’t like a profusion of them, but thought a few fine ones the best.
    Spoke of the Jewels which Queen Charlotte left to her daughters. Lord
    Melbourne said the Queen Consort can do with her <em>own</em> things what
    she pleases; can make her own Will, and “is a <i>femme seule</i>,” for
    no other woman can—all is her husband’s. Lord Melbourne (in reply to
    my question when he first knew George IV.) said, as soon as he could
    remember any one; he was 4 when the King was 21, in ’83, when Lord
    Melbourne’s father was first put about the Prince of Wales. “He used
    to be at Whitehall, or Piccadilly<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> where we then lived, morning,
    noon and night,” Lord Melbourne said; and he used to come down to
    Brocket; he always was fond of children and took notice of them; I
    said he took notice of me; I observed how much more submissive we
    were to him than to the late King; Lord Melbourne said George IV. had
    more power. Lord Melbourne said <em>none</em> of the Royal Family could
    marry without the Sovereign’s leave since the Marriage Act, passed
    early in George III.’s reign, in consequence, Lord Melbourne believes,
    of the Duke of Cumberland’s marrying a Mrs. Luttrell<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> <span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>which was
    very much disliked; else the Duke of Sussex might have married Lady
    Augusta, and the late King Mrs. Jordan, Lord Melbourne said. The member
    of the Royal Family, Lord Melbourne continued, gives notice to the
    Privy Council of his intention to marry, and if they don’t disapprove,
    it’s supposed the King will consent. Lord Melbourne said it was a
    difficult subject the marriage of the Royal Family; marrying a subject
    was inconvenient, and there was inconvenience in foreigners; “It was
    very often done” (marrying subjects); “Kings did it; and I don’t know
    there was any harm in it,” said Lord Melbourne. Anne Hyde was the last
    who married a Prince who became <em>King</em>, and that was considered
    a dreadful thing. Lord M. said he had been looking at some of those
    letters [George III.’s] to Lord North which seemed to him very ill
    written,<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> both as to hand and style, and in bad English. Lord North
    was a great favourite of George IV.’s, Lord Melbourne said; “Lord North
    was a very easy, good-natured man,” and the King knew him “when he
    first came in to life.” Lord Thurlow, whom Mr. Pitt beat and turned out
    in ’93,<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> turned to George IV. and became also a great favourite of
    his. He was clever but ill-tempered, Lord Melbourne said.</p>

  <p><i>Wednesday, 29th August.</i>—Lord Melbourne said he had been looking
    at those letters to Lord North, and found on closer examination that
    they were written with much more practical knowledge and knowledge of
    men than he had at first thought. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>letters he has been reading
    are relative to a Negotiation which the King entered into, with the
    Opposition, in order to strengthen the Government; and Lord Melbourne
    related several parts of it, which made him smile and which he said
    were true enough. Lord Melbourne said he (George III.) couldn’t bear
    Mr. Fox, for that he says in one of these letters that he (Lord North)
    might offer him any situation which did not bring him in immediate
    contact with the King, or into the Closet; and as he (Mr. Fox) never
    had any principles, he wouldn’t have any difficulty in changing. These
    letters prove, Lord Melbourne said, what strong personal dislikes the
    King had. These letters to Lord North, Lord M. thinks, were returned
    to George IV. by Mrs. Douglas on the death of her husband, who was
    the son of Lady Glenbervie, Lord North’s daughter; Lord North had
    three daughters, Lady Glenbervie, Lady Sheffield, and Lady Charlotte
    Lindsay (whom I know); all very clever, Lord M. says. He had 3 sons,
    George (who was a very pleasant, lively man and a great bon-vivant,
    Lord M. says), Frederic, and Frank; who were all in succession Earls
    of Guilford. The present Lord is son to Lord North’s brother<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> who
    was a Bishop, Lord M. told me. Lord North died in ’93, and Lord M.
    remembers seeing him (when Lord M. was a boy) led into the House of
    Lords, quite blind, at Hastings’ trial; he was Lord Guilford for a very
    short time.</p>

  <p>Lord M. does not think that George III. was very fond of Mr. Pitt.
    Spoke of the violent dislikes George III. and George IV. had; William
    IV. had them also, but Lord M. said they were easily got over.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>Spoke of George III.’s hand-writing; of mine, which Lord M. thinks
    very legible and generally very good; of my inclination to imitate
    hand-writings, and people,—which Lord M. said, showed quickness, and
    was in the Family; of George IV.’s mimickry. I said I kept a journal,
    which, as Lord Melbourne said, is very laborious, but a very good
    thing; for that it was astonishing in transacting business, how much
    one forgot, and how one forgot <em>why</em> one did the things.</p>

  <p><i>Thursday, 30th August.</i>— ... I gave Lord M. this Pamphlet of Sir
    H. Taylor’s which Mamma lent me. We talked about many things, and in
    going home I asked Lord M. how long Lord North had been Prime Minister
    to George III.; “From ’70 till ’82,” he told me. “The Duke of Grafton”
    (who preceded him, and was the present Duke of Grafton’s father) “went
    away,” Lord M. continued, “without telling any body and without telling
    the King; they were difficult times, and he went away; I know why he
    went away, people are always doing those foolish things; and the King
    didn’t know what to do; he sent for Lord Gower”<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> (I forget what
    he was), who, I think Lord M. said, refused it; “and then he sent for
    his Chancellor of the Exchequer” (Lord North) “and made him his Prime
    Minister.” Lord M. spoke of Dr. Keate, and told me an anecdote of him
    and George III.; and then he said that Dr. Keate couldn’t bear to be
    reminded of his boyish days at Eton; somebody, who Lord M. knows,
    reminded Keate when he was walking across the School-Yard with him, of
    the window, pointing at it, out of which they had often jumped, upon
    which Dr. Keate said, “Don’t mention it; it’s a very foolish remark.”</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span></p>

  <p><i>Friday, 31st August.</i>—Lord M. then said, that the French were
    going to send out a fleet to Mexico, with which State they have been
    in a quarrel for some time,—and that they meant to send the Prince
    de Joinville with it, to ask for reparation, and if not, to attack
    the fort of Aloa which commands the river, and which it would not be
    agreeable for us if the French were to possess; and Lord Palmerston
    proposes we should send a swift sailing Vessel to Mexico to apprize
    the Mexicans of what was to take place and to advise them to make
    reparation. And also, Lord P. proposes sending a Vessel to Guiana,
    where the French are making great encroachments, and to see what they
    are about.</p>

  <p>Lady Cork<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> is 92, a very strange old woman; Lord M. knows her; she
    was clever, a great favourite of George III. and Queen Charlotte. She
    was a Miss Monckton, sister to Lord Galway, he said. Lord M. said in
    returning Dr. Hook’s sermon (which I sent him to read) when he came in,
    that it was eager, but nothing very particular, and able. Lady Holland
    seems “very fond of Senfft,” Lord M. observed; “she would settle that
    Embassy too, as she does every thing else,” he said laughing. Lord M.
    said, in speaking of Taylor’s pamphlet,<a id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> “There is no force in it;
    it isn’t pointed.” Taylor is very fond of writing, he says, and fancies
    he writes well. Spoke of Lady C. Bury’s book.<a id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Lord M. says these
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>things make less impression than people fancy; they “make a day’s
    noise; but nobody minds them much.” Spoke of Lady Anne Hamilton,<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
    who attended Queen Caroline at her Trial; Lady Charlotte Lindsay
    gave evidence. “Lord Egremont said,” continued Lord M., “‘As for
    Guilford,<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> he twaddled like a waiting maid when he gave evidence;
    but his Sister lied like a man,’” which made us both laugh very much.
    Spoke of Kenney,<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> who is Author (Lord M. told me) of <cite>Love, Law,
    and Physic</cite>, and <cite>Raising the Wind</cite>, and is at Holland House.
    Spoke of my knowing Rogers and Moore; having seen Scott and Southey.
    Lord M. rather admires Southey’s works, and thinks his <cite>Life of
    Nelson</cite> very pretty. Spoke of his <cite>Life of Cowper</cite>. Spoke of a
    new book lying on the table, sent to me by Granville Penn,<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> which
    Lord M. looked at and said he thought might be curious; it is the
    <cite>Life of Sir William Penn</cite>, Admiral in Cromwell’s time, and who,
    with Venables, took Jamaica. Spoke of Mrs. Hutchinson’s <cite>Memoirs of
    Colonel Hutchinson</cite>, which Lord M. thinks very curious; spoke of
    her violence; spoke of Clarendon’s book which Lord M. said “is a fine
    book.” I observed there were few books on the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>Parliamentary side; he
    replied few at the time, but a good many since. He mentioned one by
    Brodie, a Scotchman; Bishop Burnet’s Memoirs of his own time, during
    Charles II.’s reign; and he said, “There is a book which I think would
    amuse Your Majesty, and would be of use to you, and which isn’t long,
    which is Guizot’s account of the Revolution.” It’s only in 2 vols., and
    is a summary of whole thing, he said.</p>

  <p>Lord M. said Lady Holland was a great friend of Pozzo’s, and that his
    first acquaintance with Pozzo was at Holland House. I asked if she knew
    Sebastiani; he said she did, but didn’t like him much, except from his
    connection with Napoleon “whom she adored.” She never knew Napoleon,
    Lord Melbourne added, but saw him at Paris at the Peace of Amiens. She
    used to send him things she knew he liked, said Lord M.; when he was
    at St. Helena she sent him <i>gâteaux</i> and chocolate, &amp;c. “She was
    half on his side,” Lord M. continued, “if not more.” Spoke of Lady
    E. Wortley’s<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> admiration for Napoleon. Soult was no friend of
    Napoleon, Lord M. said; none of them, he continued, were to be compared
    to Napoleon himself; the two best after Napoleon, Lord M. said, were
    Dessaix who was killed at Marengo, and Kleber who was murdered in Egypt.</p>

  <p>I asked Lord M. what Lord Gower, whom he mentioned to me before, was;
    that Lord Gower, he said, was the Duke of Sutherland’s grandfather; he
    was “Lord Privy Seal” when the King sent <span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>for him.<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> “He did not
    think himself equal to it” (being Prime Minister); “he was a man who
    took great part in politics.” Lord M. also told me that he believes
    the present Lord Bute to be the great-grandson of the Minister of
    George III. “George III. found the Duke of Newcastle and Mr. Pitt, and
    everything was going on very well, when he was advised to change; he
    couldn’t bear Mr. Pitt; who was afterwards Lord Chatham; and he took
    Lord Bute in his place; and then followed all that unpopularity.” I
    asked if these letters of George III. showed great confidence in Lord
    North; Lord M. said “they show a great liking for him, more than a
    great confidence.” That the King never seemed to think him strong
    enough; Lord North, all along, Lord M. continued, was pursuing a
    Policy contrary to what he himself approved, but which he was urged
    to by the King: and Lord North remonstrated very much with the King.
    The difference, Lord M. observed before, between George IV. and his
    father, was, that the former (which Knighton’s Memoirs show, Lord M.
    said) always required somebody to lean upon, whereas the latter always
    wished to act for himself, and only yielded, but said at the same time
    he disliked doing it. He never would have yielded on the Catholic
    Question, Lord M. continued, nor would the Duke of York; the late King
    was for it; but George IV. did it very unwillingly. George III. was
    deeply hurt at the loss of the American provinces, which I observed was
    no wonder; I said I thought it was <em>his</em> fault. Lord M. said most
    likely it was; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>but that it was impossible any longer to keep up the
    great Colonial Policy, namely that they should exclusively trade with
    England and make nothing for themselves; even Lord Chatham, Lord M.
    said, who all along advocated their cause, “said they shouldn’t drive
    one hob-nail for themselves.” The Separation was easily done, they
    had nothing to do but to declare it. Lord M. continued that the first
    settlers were composed of people who left England in discontent,—of
    dissenters &amp;c., and consequently no loyal people could spring from
    them. Spoke of the people whom William III. ennobled, which I’ve no
    time to enumerate. He told a most absurd anecdote of a very fat little
    porter at Lansdowne House. “He is a leading man in all the Parish
    Debates,” said Lord M.; “and somebody told Albemarle, ‘He speaks very
    well; to tell you the truth he speaks very like my lord.’”</p>

    <a id="Footnote_362" href="#FNanchor_362" class="label">[362]</a> The Canadian question was one of the most difficult
      of the early years of the Queen’s reign. Upper and Lower Canada
      were totally dissimilar in race, tradition, and natural position.
      Lower Canada was peopled mainly by French Roman Catholics, Upper
      Canada by Scottish Protestants, and the mode of Government in both
      was as cumbrous and inappropriate as it could well be, and afforded
      unquestionable ground for grievance on the part of the inhabitants. In
      1836 a rebellion broke out in the Lower Province headed by Papineau,
      who had been Speaker of the Assembly. This was followed by an
      insurrection in the Upper Province, which was quelled in a striking
      and almost quixotic manner by Sir Francis Head, the Governor, who,
      dismissing all his regular troops to the Lower Province, trusted to
      the people to put down the malcontents, and succeeded. Lord Durham was
      sent out in 1838 as High Commissioner and Governor-General. His report
      on the proper method of administering the Colony is historical, and
      ultimately formed the basis of settlement. His acts were not approved
      by the Whig Government and were annulled by them. He anticipated his
      recall by resigning and coming home before the end of 1838.

      This led to constant friction and even to open hostilities between

      of territory again led to a war which is chiefly notable for the
      siege of Antwerp in 1832. In 1838 Holland announced for the first
      time her readiness to accede to the provisions of the Treaty of
      1832. The Belgians claimed that this acquiescence came too late, but
